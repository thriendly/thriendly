<h2 id="how-to-create-midjourney-prompts-for-architecture">How to create midjourney prompts for architecture</h2>
<p>Every text to image AI Art tool requires some kind of fine tuning for stunning image outputs. 
To create innovative architectures, you can structure the prompt in the following way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Generate a [2D/3D] [architectural element] inspired by [architect name] with [architectural style] [description of the architectural element], incorporating [additional design elements].</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that text inside square brackets are variables. These are optional fields and feel free to playaround them.</p>

<h5 id="2d3d">[2D/3D]</h5>
<p>This refers to the dimension of the architectural representation. You can choose whether you want the AI to generate a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) depiction of the architectural element.</p>

<p>Example: Generate a 3D skyscraper…</p>

<h5 id="architectural-element">[architectural element]</h5>
