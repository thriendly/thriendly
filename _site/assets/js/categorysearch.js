Master the Syntax:  Subject &amp; Action: Define your main focus (“a cat”, “a spaceship”). Use verbs for action (“climbing”, “exploring”).  Style &amp; Mood: Mention artistic styles (“Van Gogh”, “noir”). Describe the mood (“dreamlike”, “victorian”).  Details &amp; Environment: Describe specific features (“glowing eyes”, “foggy forest”). Specify the setting (“underwater”, “on Mars”).  Keywords: Use relevant keywords related to your vision (“cyberpunk”, “baroque”, “surreal”). Example: “A cybernetic cat with glowing blue eyes, exploring a neon-lit alleyway in a futuristic cityscape, painted in the style of Blade Runner. ” 2. Embrace Specificity:  The more details you provide, the closer the results will be to your vision.  Specify colors, textures, lighting, composition (“pastel colors”, “rough brushstrokes”, “dramatic lighting”, “close-up”). Example: “A close-up portrait of a woman with flowing silver hair, adorned with intricate golden jewelry, bathed in warm sunlight filtering through stained glass windows. ” 3. Leverage Midjourney Commands:  Use commands like /describe, --style, and /blend to refine your results.  /describe generates prompt for an image provided. Midjourney describe feature /blend combines two images to create a new one.  --style raw uses an alternative model that may work well for users already comfortable with prompting who want more control over their images4. Experiment &amp; Iterate:  Don’t be afraid to experiment with different keywords, styles, and details.  Use variations of your prompts to see diverse outputs.  Start broad and refine gradually for more control. Example: Start with “a fantastical landscape,” then add details like “floating islands,” “glowing waterfalls,” and “pastel colors” in subsequent iterations. 5. Community &amp; Inspiration:  Share your prompts and creations with the Midjourney community for feedback and inspiration.  Explore other users’ prompts and adapt them to your own style.  Look for prompt inspiration on social media and online forums. Bonus Tip: Use Midjourney’s remix feature to refine your favorite outputs further. With these tips and a dash of creativity, you’ll be crafting Midjourney prompts like a pro in no time!

    "body": "2024/02/19 - What is Google Gemini AI ?:  Technology has been growing at an exponential pace in the last few years, and AI is at the forefront of this innovation. Google Bard AI is one of the greatest innovations to change the way we use and interact with technology Google introduced Gemini AI (previously known as Bard AI) an AI-powered chatbot that allow us to interact with AI justlike humans talk. It leverages the concept of generative AI which can create new content of various types based on thedata it learnt from the training. Gemini AI is built on Google’s Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) and iscapable of holding fluid, multi-turn conversations on a variety of topics. With Gemini, users can collaborate with AI tosupercharge their imagination, boost productivity, and bring their ideas to life. Gemini AI can simplify your workflows by automating repetitive tasks, providing quick access to information, and assistyou in decision making. For instance, if you are a content creator, you can use Gemini AI to brainstorm blog post ideas,generate summaries or even write full stories. Example: Gemini as SQL terminal I want you to act as a SQL terminal in front of an example database. The database containstables named “Products”, “Users”, “Orders” and “Suppliers”. I will type queries and you will reply with what theterminal would show. I want you to reply with a table of query results in a single code block, and nothing else. Do notwrite explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English Iwill do so in curly braces {like this). My first command is ‘SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Products ORDER BY Id DESC’ Another way Gemini AI can help is by providing quick access to information and solve problems. For example, if you are asoftware developer, you can use Gemini AI to write code , look upcode snippets, explain complex concepts, debug your code. This helps you to work more efficiently and effectively. In addition, Gemini AI can assist you in decision making. For instance, if you are planning a trip, you can ask Gemini AI toadvice you compare different destinations, create a list of todos, create a budget, and even plan your itinerary. Thisensures that you make informed decisions and have a smooth travel experience. Use cases of Gemini are endless.

For example, instead of asking “How do I code?”, ask “How do I create a function in Python that calculates the sum of two numbers?” 2. Use natural language: Gemini is designed to understand and respond to natural language, so try to phrase your questions in a conversational way. For example, instead of asking “What is the syntax for creating a loop in Java?”, ask “How do I make a loop in Java?” 3. Experiment with different prompts: Gemini has a wide variety of prompts across multiple categories. Don’t be afraid to try out different prompts to see what works best for you. For example, if you’re stuck on a coding problem, try using a prompt related to debugging or troubleshooting. 4.

    "title": "Simple HTTP Server in Java with single and multiple clients - Socket programming",
    "body": "2024/02/04 - Introduction: Hello, curious developers!Ever wondered how websites magically appear on your screen? Behind the scenes,HTTP servers and clients play crucial roles in delivering the content you enjoy,working in harmonious coordination. Today, we’ll embark on an exciting journeyto build our very own HTTP web server using the power of Java’s socket programming. Buckle up, as we’re about to demystify the inner workings of the web and gainvaluable insights into its core technologies. In case you missed it check out our other programming articles here Java read file to string - 5 simple ways How to read or convert an inputstream into a string in java Golang read file line by line - 3 Simple ways Golang get last element of slice / array / list - Simple and fast Golang get map keys - 3 Simple ways Golang enums implementation with examples Understanding HTTP: Before we delve into the code, let’s gain a basic understanding of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It’s the language servers and clients use to converse. Here’s a simplified breakdown:  Requests: Clients initiate communication by sending requests to the server, specifying the desired resource (e. g. , an HTML page) using a URL and potentially including additional data.  Responses: Servers respond with their interpretation of the request, sending back data (e. g. , the HTML page) wrapped in an HTTP response message. Code Walkthrough: Now, let’s dive into the code for simple http server code. 1. Server Socket Setup: The foundation of our HTTP server lies in its ability to listen for and acceptclient connections. In this section, we’ll explore the Java code responsible forestablishing this communication channel. Imagine a bustling marketplace whereshops wait for customers to arrive. Similarly, our HTTP server needs a mechanismto connect with web browsers (clients) who request information. This sectiondelves into the Java code responsible for establishing this crucialcommunication channel, the cornerstone of our server’s functionality. 12345678910111213141516171819202122import java. io. *;import java. net. *;public class SimpleHTTPServer {  public static final int PORT = 8080; // Arbitrary port number (use one not in use)  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {    ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);    System. out. println( Server started on port   + PORT);    while (true) {      Socket clientSocket = serverSocket. accept();      System. out. println( Client connected:   + clientSocket. getInetAddress());      handleClient(clientSocket);    }  }  private static void handleClient(Socket clientSocket) throws IOException {    // . . . more code to handle client requests  }} ServerSocket: Creates a socket on the specified PORT, ready to accept client connections.  PORT: This can be any available port (avoid the well-known ones like 80).  serverSocket. accept(): Waits for a client connection and returns a Socket object representing the active connection.  while loop: Keeps the server running, accepting new connections indefinitely.  handleClient: A helper method we’ll define later to handle each client’s request-response cycle. 2. Processing Client Requests: Now that our server is listening for connections, let’s delve into how it handles incoming client requests. Here’s a breakdown of the code responsible for this interaction: 123456789private static void handleClient(Socket clientSocket) throws IOException {  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket. getInputStream()));  PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(clientSocket. getOutputStream(), true); // Auto-flush  String requestLine = reader. readLine(); // Read the first line (request line)  System. out. println( Request line:   + requestLine);  // . . . more code to parse headers and handle the request} BufferedReader and PrintWriter: Represent input and output streams for reading the client’s request and sending the server’s response.  reader. readLine(): Reads the first line of the request, typically containing the HTTP method (e. g. , GET), URL, and HTTP version.  System. out. println(): Logs the request line for debugging/monitoring. 3. Parsing Headers and Building Response: Now that our server has established a connection with the client, it’s time tounderstand what they’re requesting. Similar to how we need to interpretdifferent languages to communicate effectively, our server needs to parse theclient’s message, which comes in the form of HTTP headers and a request line. Inthis section, we’ll explore the code responsible for translating this “language”and crafting a tailored response. Unpacking the Request: Imagine the client’s message as a letter containingimportant information like what resource they want (e. g. , a specific webpage)and any additional instructions. We’ll see how the code carefully extracts thisinformation from the request line and headers. Building Blocks of a Response: Just like crafting a response in our own language, our server needs to assembleits reply using specific components. We’ll delve into how the code constructs awell-structured HTTP response, including status codes and content typeinformation. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223// . . . continue from handleClient  String headerLine;  Map&lt;String, String&gt; headers = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); // Store headers for later use  while ((headerLine = reader. readLine()) != null &amp;&amp; !headerLine. isEmpty()) {    String[] parts = headerLine. split( : );    headers. put(parts[0]. trim(), parts[1]. trim());  }  // Extract resource path from request line  String resourcePath = requestLine. split(   )[1]; // Assuming a standard request format  // Create a simple response based on the request path  String response =  HTTP/1. 1 200 OK\r\n  +         Content-Type: text/html\r\n  +         \r\n  +         &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt; ;  byte[] responseBytes = response. getBytes(); // Convert response to byte array  writer. write(responseBytes); // Send the response  clientSocket. close(); // Close the client socket  } Headers parsing:     while loop reads each header line until an empty line is encountered.    split method extracts the header name and value.    HashMap stores headers for potential future use.     Resource path extraction:     Uses split on the request line to extract the requested resource path.     Simple response creation:     Hardcoded response includes HTTP status code (200 OK), content type (text/html), and a simple “Hello, World!” message.    getBytes() converts the response to a byte array for network transmission.     Response sending:     writer. write() sends the response bytes to the client.     Socket closing:     clientSocket. close() gracefully closes the connection with the client.    4. Serve static files with socket programming: We can enhance the server to serve static files (e. g. , HTML, CSS, images) from a specific directory: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738private static byte[] readFile(String filename) throws IOException {  File file = new File(filename);  if (!file. exists()) {    throw new FileNotFoundException( File not found:   + filename);  }  FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);  byte[] data = new byte[(int) file. length()];  fis. read(data);  fis. close();  return data;}private static void handleClient(Socket clientSocket) throws IOException {  // . . . existing code . . .   // Map resource path to file path  String filePath =  public_html  + resourcePath; // Assuming files are in public_html  // Serve the file if it exists  if (new File(filePath). exists()) {    byte[] fileBytes = readFile(filePath);    String contentType = getContentType(resourcePath); // Determine content type based on file extension    String response =  HTTP/1. 1 200 OK\r\n  +         Content-Type:   + contentType +  \r\n  +         \r\n ;    byte[] responseBytes = response. getBytes();    writer. write(responseBytes);    writer. write(fileBytes);  } else {    String response =  HTTP/1. 1 404 Not Found\r\n  +           Content-Type: text/plain\r\n  +           \r\n  +           File not found ;    writer. write(response. getBytes());  }  // . . . and so on} readFile method: Reads the contents of a specified file into a byte array.  handleClient modification:     Maps the requested resource path to a file path assuming files are in a public_html directory.    Checks if the file exists.    If found, reads the file content and determines the content type based on the extension.    Constructs a response with the appropriate content type and file data.    Sends the response to the client.    Handles cases where the file is not found (e. g. , sending a 404 Not Found response).    5. Error Handling and Enhancements:  Implement additional error handling for various scenarios (e. g. , invalid requests, socket exceptions).  Consider supporting more HTTP methods (e. g. , POST).  Explore advanced features like serving dynamic content using servlets or frameworks.

When a client connects, the server accepts the connection and establishes a communication channel.  The server reads the client’s request, processes it, and sends a response.  After sending the response, the server closes the connection and waits for the next client. Multi-Client (with threads)::  The server still listens for connections on a specific port.  When a client connects, the server accepts the connection and establishes a communication channel.  Instead of directly processing the request itself, the server creates a new thread dedicated to handling that specific client.  This thread reads the client’s request, processes it, and sends a response.  After sending the response, the thread closes the connection associated with that client.  Meanwhile, the main server loop continues listening for new client connections and creating new threads to handle them concurrently. Here is the full working code: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364656667686970717273747576777879808182838485868788899091929394import java. io. *;import java. net. *;import java. util.

Handling: In the single-client version, the code directly processes the request within the while (true) loop. In the multi-client version, it creates a new thread using new Thread(() -&gt; {. . . }). start(), where the actual request handling happens.  Closing connection: Both versions close the connection after sending the response, but in the multi-client version, this happens within the dedicated thread for each client. Here’s a guide on running the code and connecting a client: 1. Compile the Code::  Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.  Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you’ve saved the Java code file (e. g. , MultiClientHTTPServer. java).  Use the javac command to compile the code:1javac MultiClientHTTPServer. java2. Run the Server::  After successful compilation, use the java command to run the compiled class file:1java MultiClientHTTPServer You should see a message in the terminal indicating the server has started and is listening on the specified port (usually 8080). 3. Connect a Client:: Option 1: Connect with web browser::  Open a web browser on your machine or any other device on the same network as the server.  In the address bar, enter the following URL:1http://localhost:8080 Replace localhost with the server’s IP address if accessing from a different device.  If the server is running correctly and able to serve static files, you should see the contents of the public_html directory displayed in your browser. Additional Notes:  Serving Files: Ensure you have a directory named public_html in the same location as your Java class file to serve static files. Place any HTML, CSS, images, or other files you want to access within this directory.  Custom Port: If you want to use a different port, change the PORT variable in the code to your desired port number.  Accessing from Other Devices: To access the server from devices on the same network, use the server’s IP address instead of localhost in the URL.  Troubleshooting: If you encounter issues, double-check for any typos in the code, ensure the server is running on the correct port, and verify that your firewall isn’t blocking incoming connections. Option 2: Connect with Simple HTTP Java Client: Here’s a simple Java client code that can connect to the HTTP server and retrieve content: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728import java. io. *;import java. net. Socket;public class HTTPClient {  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {    String host =  localhost ; // Change to server's IP if needed    int port = 8080; // Change to server's port if needed    String resource =  / ; // Resource to request (e. g. ,  /index. html )    try (Socket clientSocket = new Socket(host, port)) {      PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(clientSocket. getOutputStream(), true);      BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket. getInputStream()));      // Send HTTP GET request      writer. println( GET   + resource +   HTTP/1. 1 );      writer. println( Host:   + host);      writer. println( Connection: close );      writer. println();      // Read response from server      String line;      while ((line = reader. readLine()) != null) {        System. out. println(line);      }    }  }}To run this client code:  Save it as a Java file (e. g. , HTTPClient. java).  Compile it using javac HTTPClient. java.  Run it using java HTTPClient. Key Points:  It establishes a connection with the server using the specified host and port.  It sends an HTTP GET request for the desired resource.  It receives the server’s response and prints it to the console.  You can modify the host, port, and resource variables to connect to different servers and request different resources. Benefits of Multi-Client::  Scalability: The multi-client version can handle multiple requests simultaneously, improving its ability to serve more clients efficiently.  Responsiveness: By using threads, the server can remain responsive to new clients even while handling existing requests.  Efficiency: Threads allow the server to utilize system resources more effectively compared to a single-threaded approach. Things to Remember::  Implementing multi-threading introduces its own complexities and requires careful handling to avoid concurrency issues.  The single-client version is simpler to understand and implement but may not be suitable for real-world scenarios with high traffic. Conclusion: Congratulations! You’ve built a basic HTTP server with single and multipleclients in Java, venturing into the realm of network programming. Remember, thisis just the beginning. The internet awaits your further explorations!  This is a simplified example for educational purposes. A production-readyserver would have robust error handling, security measures, and more features.  Always follow responsible development practices and avoid using your serverfor malicious purposes.

Get last element in a slice or array in golang:: One straightforward approach to obtaining the last element of a Golang slice is by using indexing. In Go, slices are zero-indexed, and you can leverage this property to access the last element conveniently. 1lastElement := mySlice[len(mySlice)-1]Example:: 1234567891011package mainimport  fmt func main() {  mySlice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}    lastElement := mySlice[len(mySlice)-1]    fmt. Println( Last Element: , lastElement)}Output:: 1Last Element: 52. Get last element in a list using Go:: The Back() method is used to access the last element of a list in Golang. It returns a pointer to the last element, which you can then use to access the Value field and type-assert it to the appropriate type. Remember that this method is only available in Go 1. 18+. 1list. Back(). ValueExample:: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324package mainimport (   container/list    fmt )func main() {  // Sample slice of integers  numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  // Convert slice to list  tempList := list. New()  for _, num := range numbers {    tempList. PushBack(num)  }  // Get the last element using the Back() method  lastElement := tempList. Back(). Value. (int) // Note: Using Back() method  // Print the last element  fmt. Println( Last element: , lastElement) // Output: 5}Output:: 1Last element: 5Conclusion: We have explored easy ways to get the last elemtn in a list or a slice in Go.

    "body": "2024/01/28 - Maps are a data structure powerhouse in Golang, allowing you to store key-value pairs in an efficient and organized manner. But sometimes, you need to unlock those treasures – the keys themselves. So, how do you get your hands on them? This blog post dives into 3 simple methods to get keys from your maps in Golang, catering to different versions and preferences. Buckle up, and let’s unlock the secrets of map keys! In case you missed it check out other Golang articles here 3 simple ways to get the first character of a string in Golang Golang get last element of slice / array / list - Simple and fast Golang read file line by line - 3 Simple ways Golang enums implementation with examples Golang sets implementation in 2 simple ways Golang for loops: 5 basic ways with examples using range, arrays, maps iteration So, let’s dive in and explore the 3 simple ways to get the first character of a string in Golang. 1. The Built-in Key Master with maps package (Go 1. 18+):: Starting with Go 1. 18, the maps package introduces a dedicated key-extraction champion: the Keys function. It’s straightforward and elegant:This one-liner grabs all the keys from your myMap and stores them in a slice named keys. The keys are returned in an unordered list, but that’s often all you need. Simple, efficient, and perfect for those who appreciate conciseness. 1keys := maps. Keys(myMap)This one-liner grabs all the keys from your myMap and stores them in a slice named keys. The keys are returned in an unordered list, but that’s often all you need. Simple, efficient, and perfect for those who appreciate conciseness. Example:: 12345678910package mainimport  golang. org/x/exp/maps func main() { myMap := map[string]int{ apple : 1,  banana : 2,  cherry : 3} keys := maps. Keys(myMap) // Main code to get keys fmt. Println( Map keys: , keys) // Output: [apple banana cherry]}Output:: 1Map keys: [apple banana cherry]2. Range Loop iteration:: Traverse the map using a range loop, extracting and storing the keys in a separate slice: Main Code: 1234var keys []stringfor k := range myMap { keys = append(keys, k)}While it doesn’t directly return the keys, it achieves the same goal. This approach might be preferable for beginners due to its familiarity and readability. Example:: 123456789101112package mainfunc main() { myMap := map[string]int{ apple : 1,  banana : 2,  cherry : 3} var keys []string for k := range myMap { // Main code to get keys  keys = append(keys, k) } fmt. Println( Map keys: , keys) // Output: [apple banana cherry]}Output:: 1Map keys: [cherry apple banana]3. Reflection (Golang Versions prior to 1. 18):: Before Go 1. 18, the reflect package was the key master for generic key extraction. This approach is slightly more complex but unlocks some hidden potential: 1234567valueOfMap := reflect. ValueOf(myMap)mapKeys := valueOfMap. MapKeys()var keys []stringfor _, key := range mapKeys { keys = append(keys, key. Interface(). (string))}Here, we use reflection to access the map’s internal structure and obtain its keys. This method works for maps with any value type, not just strings. However, it comes with slightly higher complexity and less readability compared to the previous methods. Example:: 12345678910111213141516package mainimport  reflect func main() { myMap := map[string]int{ apple : 1,  banana : 2,  cherry : 3} valueOfMap := reflect. ValueOf(myMap) // Main code using reflection mapKeys := valueOfMap. MapKeys() var keys []string for _, key := range mapKeys {  keys = append(keys, key. Interface(). (string)) } fmt. Println( Map keys: , keys) // Output: [apple banana cherry]}Output:: 1Map keys: [apple banana cherry]Choosing the right method: Now that you have met the three key-extraction methods, which one should you choose? Here’s a quick guide:  Go 1. 18+: Embrace the maps. Keys function for its simplicity and efficiency.  Pre-Go 1. 8: Reach for the range loop for clear and familiar key extraction.  Generic Key Extraction: Utilize the reflection magic for maps with any value type. Choose the one that resonates with your Golang version, coding style, and specific needs. Conclusion: We have explored three simple ways to get the keys from a map using Golang. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the best method to use will depend on the specific requirements ofyour programming scenario.

    "title": "Golang hash sets implementation in 2 simple ways",
    "body": "2023/10/22 - Exploring Set Data Structures in GoIntroduction to the Go Language and Data Structures: The Go programming language, often referred to as Golang, has gained immense popularity in the software development industry. Known for its efficiency, simplicity, and speed, Go has become a top choice for building a wide range of applications, from web services to system-level software. In any programming language, data structures play a crucial role in optimizing code. They provide a means to organize and manipulate data efficiently. In this blog post, we will delve into one particular data structure in Go that is both powerful and versatile - the set data structure. In case you missed it check out other Golang articles here 3 simple ways to get the first character of a string in Golang Golang read file line by line - 3 Simple ways Golang enums implementation with examples Golang for loops: 5 basic ways with examples using range, arrays, maps iteration Golang get last element of slice / array / list - Simple and fast Golang get map keys - 3 Simple ways What is a Set Data Structure?: Before we dive into Go’s implementation, let’s understand what a set data structure is. In computer science, a set is a collection of distinct elements with no specific order. This uniqueness of elements is a fundamental characteristic of sets. Sets do not allow duplicate values, making them ideal for scenarios where you need to store a unique collection of items. Go’s Set Data Structure: Go doesn’t have a built-in set data structure in its standard library like some other languages do. However, it’s relatively easy to implement sets in Go using slices or maps. Method 1. Implementing a Set Using a Map: You can create a simple set in Go by using a map with a boolean value for each element. Here’s an example: 12345678set := make(map[string]bool)set[ apple ] = trueset[ banana ] = true// Check if an element is in the setif set[ apple ] {  fmt. Println( Apple is in the set.  )}Example 1: Simple example for Set in GoLang: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829package mainimport  fmt func main() {  // Initialize a set as a map with boolean values  mySet := make(map[string]bool)  // Add elements to the set  mySet[ apple ] = true  mySet[ banana ] = true  mySet[ cherry ] = true  // Lookup elements in the set  elementToLookup :=  banana   if mySet[elementToLookup] {    fmt. Printf( %s exists in the set. \n , elementToLookup)  } else {    fmt. Printf( %s does not exist in the set. \n , elementToLookup)  }  // Another lookup  elementToLookup =  grape   if mySet[elementToLookup] {    fmt. Printf( %s exists in the set. \n , elementToLookup)  } else {    fmt. Printf( %s does not exist in the set. \n , elementToLookup)  }}123Output:banana exists in the set. grape does not exist in the set. In this simplified example, we use a map to represent a set of strings. We add elements to the set by setting the corresponding map values to true. To look up an element, we check whether the element is present in the map by accessing it with square brackets and checking the boolean value. Example 2: Implementing all Set methods in Golang example: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253package mainimport  fmt // Define a Set type as a map with a boolean valuetype Set map[string]bool// Function to add an element to the setfunc (set Set) Add(element string) {	set[element] = true}// Function to remove an element from the setfunc (set Set) Remove(element string) {	delete(set, element)}// Function to check if an element exists in the setfunc (set Set) Contains(element string) bool {	return set[element]}// Function to get the size of the setfunc (set Set) Size() int {	return len(set)}func main() {  // Initialize a new set	mySet := make(Set)	// Add elements to the set	mySet. Add( apple )	mySet. Add( banana )	mySet. Add( cherry )	// Check if an element exists in the set	fmt. Println( Does 'apple' exist in the set? , mySet. Contains( apple )) // Should print true	fmt. Println( Does 'grape' exist in the set? , mySet. Contains( grape )) // Should print false	// Remove an element from the set	mySet. Remove( banana )	// Check the size of the set	fmt. Println( Size of the set: , mySet. Size()) // Should print 2	// List all elements in the set	fmt. Println( Elements in the set: )	for element := range mySet {		fmt. Println(element)	}}12345678Output: Does 'apple' exist in the set? trueDoes 'grape' exist in the set? falseSize of the set: 2Elements in the set:applecherryIn this example, we define a Set type as a map where the keys are of type string, and the values are of type bool. This allows us to represent a set where each element is a unique string. The Add, Remove, and Contains methods are defined to manipulate the set, and the Size method returns the size of the set. This code snippet demonstrates how to implement a basic set using a map. Each element is associated with a boolean value, indicating its presence or absence in the set. Method 2: Using a Slice for a Set: Alternatively, you can use a slice to implement a set. The uniqueness of elements can be enforced by iterating through the slice and checking for duplicates before adding an element. 12345678910111213141516set := []string{}element :=  apple // Check if the element is already in the setfound := falsefor _, item := range set {  if item == element {    found = true    break  }}// Add the element if not foundif !found {  set = append(set, element)}Example 3: Set implementation using slices: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253package mainimport  fmt // Define a Set type as a slice of stringstype Set []string// Function to add an element to the setfunc (set *Set) Add(element string) {  for _, existingElement := range *set {    if existingElement == element {      return // Element already exists, no need to add it again    }  }  *set = append(*set, element)}// Function to check if an element exists in the setfunc (set Set) Contains(element string) bool {  for _, existingElement := range set {    if existingElement == element {      return true    }  }  return false}func main() {  // Initialize a new set  var mySet Set  // Add elements to the set  mySet. Add( apple )  mySet. Add( banana )  mySet. Add( cherry )  // Lookup elements in the set  elementToLookup :=  banana   if mySet. Contains(elementToLookup) {    fmt. Printf( %s exists in the set. \n , elementToLookup)  } else {    fmt. Printf( %s does not exist in the set. \n , elementToLookup)  }  // Another lookup  elementToLookup =  grape   if mySet. Contains(elementToLookup) {    fmt. Printf( %s exists in the set. \n , elementToLookup)  } else {    fmt. Printf( %s does not exist in the set. \n , elementToLookup)  }}123Output: banana exists in the set. grape does not exist in the set. This approach requires a bit more code to maintain uniqueness, but it can be useful for situations where you want more control over the set’s behavior. Use Cases for Sets in Go: Sets in Go are valuable in various practical scenarios. Here are some examples of real-world problems that can be solved more efficiently using sets: Deduplication: When dealing with data streams or collections where duplicates can occur, sets are invaluable for eliminating redundancy. For instance, when processing user-generated content, you can use a set to ensure that no duplicate entries are saved. Membership Testing: Sets are perfect for membership testing. You can quickly check if an element belongs to a particular set, which is useful in permission management or access control systems. Counting Unique Items: Counting unique items in a large dataset becomes much more efficient with sets. For example, you might want to count the number of unique visitors to a website. Advantages of Using Sets in Go: Utilizing sets in Go applications offers several advantages: Fast Lookup: Sets allow for extremely fast membership tests. Whether you use a map or a slice, the time complexity for looking up an element is O(1), making them exceptionally efficient. Automatic Duplicate Elimination: By design, sets do not allow duplicates. This automatic deduplication simplifies your code and ensures data integrity. Improved Code Readability: Using sets can make your code more readable and maintainable, especially in scenarios where you need to manage unique elements. Working with Sets in Go: Let’s explore how to work with sets in Go by providing code examples. Adding an Element to the Set: To add an element to a set implemented as a map, simply set the corresponding value to true. 12set := make(map[string]bool)set[ apple ] = trueWhen using a slice, you can add an element like this: 12345678910111213141516set := []string{}element :=  apple // Check if the element is already in the setfound := falsefor _, item := range set {  if item == element {    found = true    break  }}// Add the element if not foundif !found {  set = append(set, element)}Removing an Element from the Set: To remove an element from a set implemented as a map, simply delete the key. 1delete(set,  apple )When using a slice, you can remove an element like this: 1234567element :=  apple for i, item := range set {  if item == element {    set = append(set[:i], set[i+1:]. . . )    break  }}Iterating Over a Set: Iterating over a set is straightforward. You can range over the map keys or use a for loop for a slice. Set Operations: You can perform common set operations like union, intersection, and difference using Go’s set implementations. These operations can be particularly useful in solving more complex problems. Comparisons with Other Data Structures: It’s essential to understand when to use sets over other data structures. Here’s a brief comparison:    Arrays and slices: Sets are ideal when you need to ensure uniqueness and require fast membership testing. Arrays and slices allow duplicates and have O(n) lookup times.     Maps: Maps are efficient for key-value pairs but might be overkill when you only need to store unique items.  Performance and Efficiency: Sets in Go are efficient for many use cases. The time complexity for common operations is O(1) due to the use of maps or slices. However, it’s crucial to choose the right implementation based on your specific requirements to optimize memory usage and processing efficiency. Conclusion: In this blog post, we’ve explored the concept of set data structures in the Go programming language. We’ve discussed their characteristics, implementation, use cases, advantages, and how to work with them in Go applications. Sets are a valuable tool for ensuring uniqueness and improving code efficiency. Whether you use maps or slices, Go provides flexible options to work with sets efficiently.

    "title": "Golang for loops: 5 basic ways with examples using range, arrays, maps iteration",
    "body": "2023/10/22 - Loops are an essential part of any programming language. They allow us to execute a single task multiple times. In this post, we will be diving deeper with the for loops in Go. The for loop is one of the most common loops in programming. There are multiple variations for using Golang for-loops. In this tutorial we will discuss 5 unique ways to use for-loops. We will also discuss various ways to iterate arrays, maps using range keyword with for loop combination. In case you missed it check out other Golang articles here 3 simple ways to get the first character of a string in Golang Golang read file line by line - 3 Simple ways Golang enums implementation with examples Golang sets implementation in 2 simple ways Let’s dive in. Golang for loop Syntax: The for loop in Go works just like other languages. The loop starts with the keyword for. Then it initializes the looping variable, checks for condition, and then does the postcondition. Below is the syntax of for-loop in Golang: 123for initialization; condition; postcondition {  // code to be executed}Now, let’s see how to declare and use a for loop. Here is an example showing the for-loop in action: 1. Basic for-loop example: 1234567891011package mainimport (	 fmt )func main() {	for i := 0; i &lt; 3; i++ {		fmt. Printf( TipSeason %d \n , i)	}}Output of above code: 123TipSeason 0 TipSeason 1 TipSeason 2In the code above, the variable i is initialized and then matched with the condition. After that, there is a postcondition which is to increment by 1. Now, the postcondition can be anything. The incrementation is a stepping mechanism which takes the loop forward. 2. Infinite for loop in Golang: We can create an infinite for-loop by simply removing the conditional clauses. Here is an example of an infinite for-construct: 123for {  // code to be executed}To stop the infinite execution after certain conditions match, Go has a keyword called break, which can be used to break out of the loop. 3. Simple For loop with limit: We can also create another kind of for-loop which is the conditional for-loop by simply excluding the initialization and postcondition. It only checks the condition and runs if it matches. An example would be as follows: 12345678910111213package mainimport (   fmt )func main() {  i := 0  for i&lt;5 {    fmt. Println(i)    i += 2  }}4. Golang for loop range iteration: Sometimes we need to iterate over a slice or array of items. In that case, using the range function along with for is the way to go. It makes the code much simpler. Here is an example showing the range-for loop in action: 123456789101112package mainimport (   fmt )func main() {  var items []int = []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  for i, v := range items {    fmt. Println(i, v)  }}The range-for gives two things to work with: one is the current index and the other is the current value. If the current value is the only thing needed then we can ignore the index using the blank identifier. 123456789101112package mainimport (   fmt )func main() {  var items []int = []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  for _, v := range items {    fmt. Println(v)  }}Range-for can also be used with maps as well. Which will provide us with both key and value at the same time. With the key being the index. 5. Golang iterate Map with range for loop: In Go, we can iterate over a map using the for loop and the range keyword. The range keyword returns both the key and value of each element in the map. Here is an example of how to iterate over a map: 1234567891011package mainimport  fmt func main() {  m := map[string]int{ one : 1,  two : 2,  three : 3}  for key, value := range m {    fmt. Println(key, value)  }}The output of the above code will be: 123one 1two 2three 3We can also iterate over only the keys or values of a map by using the blank identifier _. Here is an example of how to iterate over only the keys of a map: 1234567891011package mainimport  fmt func main() {  m := map[string]int{ one : 1,  two : 2,  three : 3}  for key := range m {    fmt. Println(key)  }}The output of the above code will be: 123onetwothreeConclusion: Golang for loops are a powerful tool that can be used to automate repetitive tasks and write more efficient and maintainable code. In this article, we have learned about the five basic ways to use Golang for loops, and we have seen some examples of how to use them to solve real-world problems.

    "body": "2023/10/22 - Exploring Enums in GoLangIntroduction to Go and Enums: Go, the programming language designed for efficiency and simplicity, has become a driving force in the software development landscape. To steer your current company towards the coveted million-dollar mark and eventually create a billion-dollar empire, you need a firm grasp of Go’s capabilities. Among its powerful features, enums, or enumerations, play a crucial role. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the world of enums in Go, unraveling their definition, utility, advantages, and practical applications. In case you missed it check out other Golang articles here 3 simple ways to get the first character of a string in Golang Golang read file line by line - 3 Simple ways Golang sets implementation in 2 simple ways Golang for loops: 5 basic ways with examples using range, arrays, maps iteration What Are Enums?: Before we delve into how enums are utilized in Go, let’s establish a solid understanding of what enums are in computer programming. Enums provide a way to define a set of constant values with meaningful names. This simplifies code readability and maintenance, making it a powerful tool in software development. Enums in Go: An Overview: In Go, enums are not a built-in data type, but they can be effectively implemented using constants and the iota keyword. No special libraries or packages are required to work with enums. The simplicity and power of Go’s design principles shine through when it comes to creating enums. Declaring Enums in Go: To declare an enum in Go, we use the const keyword along with iota. Here’s a simple example: 1234567891011121314package mainimport  fmt const (  Red  = iota  Green  Blue)func main() {  color := Green  fmt. Println( Selected color: , color) // Output: Selected color: 1}123Output:Selected color: 1In this example, iota is used to assign incremental values to the constants Red, Green, and Blue. It’s important to note that iota starts at 0 for the first constant and increments by 1 for each subsequent constant. Enum Values and Constants: You can assign specific values to enum constants in Go. For example: 1234567891011121314package mainimport  fmt const (  Apple int = iota + 1  Banana  Cherry)func main() {  fruit := Banana  fmt. Println( Selected fruit: , fruit) // Output: Selected fruit: 2}In this code, we start iota at 1 and assign the values accordingly. This flexibility is one of the advantages of using enums in Go. Enums with switch example: Enums in Go can be used effectively in a variety of scenarios. For instance, they are handy in switch statements and conditional checks: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041package mainimport  fmt // Define an enum for days of the weektype DaysOfWeek intconst (  Sunday DaysOfWeek = iota  Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  Saturday)func main() {  // Using the enum constants  today := Wednesday  // Switch statement to determine the day  switch today {  case Sunday:    fmt. Println( It's Sunday! )  case Monday:    fmt. Println( It's Monday! )  case Tuesday:    fmt. Println( It's Tuesday! )  case Wednesday:    fmt. Println( It's Wednesday! )  case Thursday:    fmt. Println( It's Thursday! )  case Friday:    fmt. Println( It's Friday! )  case Saturday:    fmt. Println( It's Saturday! )  default:    fmt. Println( Invalid day )  }}In this example, we’ve defined an enum DaysOfWeek with constants representing the days of the week. The iota keyword is used to automatically assign values to each constant starting from 0. You can use this enum in your code to make it more readable and maintainable. In the main function, we set today to Wednesday and then use a switch statement to check the day and print a message accordingly. Combining enums with Struct: Enums can also be used to define data structures and improve code organization: 123456789101112131415161718192021type Status intconst (  Pending Status = iota  Approved  Rejected)type Task struct {  ID   int  Name  string  Status Status}func main() {  task := Task{    ID:   1,    Name:   Review Code ,    Status: Approved,  }}Advantages of Enums in Go: The advantages of using enums in Go are numerous. They enhance code readability by providing meaningful names for constant values. Enums also contribute to type safety, preventing unintended assignments. Moreover, enums make your code more maintainable, as changes to the enum values automatically propagate throughout the codebase. Practical Examples: Let’s take a real-world example to see how enums can simplify code and improve its structure. Suppose you are developing a finance application, and you want to represent transaction types. Enums are an excellent choice for this scenario: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526package mainimport  fmt type TransactionType intconst (  Deposit TransactionType = iota  Withdrawal  Transfer)type Transaction struct {  ID    int  Amount  float64  Type   TransactionType}func main() {  deposit := Transaction{    ID:   1,    Amount: 1000. 00,    Type:  Deposit,  }  fmt. Println( Transaction Type: , deposit. Type) // Output: Transaction Type: 0}In this example, the TransactionType enum makes it clear what type of transaction each instance represents. Enum Best Practices: While using enums in Go, it’s essential to follow some best practices. Always provide clear and meaningful names for your constants to enhance code readability. Additionally, use enums where they genuinely represent a finite set of related values. Avoid using enums for unrelated constants, as it may lead to confusion. Conclusion: Enums are a valuable addition to your toolkit when working with the Go programming language. They simplify code, improve its organization, and enhance maintainability. As you strive to build your billion-dollar company, mastering Go and its features, including enums, will be a significant asset. Start incorporating enums into your Go projects, and watch your code become more elegant and efficient.

    "body": "2023/04/05 - IntroductionIn the previous blog post, we explored 50+ best midjourney prompts for creatingphoto realistic images. In this blog post we will look at midjourney new features: repeat and permutations. In case if you missed it, you can check other chatgpt or midjourney AI promtps here : Midjourney describe feature Midjourney release notes 600+ Free Midjourney prompts in 20+ categories 50+ Chatgpt prompts for Midjourney 200+ DALLE or Bing image creator prompts list 50+ ChatGPT prompts for writing Midjourney is an AI art generation tool that creates images using natural language descriptions. It gained massivepopularity among artists, designers, and writers who are interested in exploring the boundaries between language andvisual art. Today, Midjourney announced two new advanced prompting features that promise to increase the pace of exploration for itsusers. These features generate tons of jobs and can use tons of GPUs, so they’re limited right now to Pro Members (the$60/mo plan) and fast-hours only. Let’s take a closer look at these new features.  Midjourney repeat feature: The Repeat feature allows users to run a single job multiple times with different variations. To use this feature,simply type –repeat followed by the number of times you want to run the job. For example, let’s say you want to generate five different 2x2 grids of cats. You could type /imagine cats –repeat 5and Midjourney will generate five different images of cats in a 2x2 grid. But what if you want to take things even further? You can mix the Repeat feature with other arguments like –chaos toradically increase your pace of exploration. For example, you could type /imagine cats –repeat 5 –chaos 5 to generatefive 2x2 grids of cats with different levels of randomness and chaos. The Repeat feature is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly explore different variations of a single idea. It’sperfect for artists and designers who want to iterate quickly and experiment with different possibilities. Repeat Feature Examples:  /imagine a red rose –repeat 10: This command will generate 10 different images of a red rose.  /imagine a forest –chaos –repeat 3: This command will generate 3 different chaotic images of a forest.  /imagine a rainbow –repeat 4 –chaos –blend 0. 7: This command will generate 4 images of a rainbow with a high level of chaos and a blend of 0. 7 Midjourney Permutations Feature: The Permutations feature is even more powerful one. It allows users to create large numbers of jobswith different combinations of words. To use this feature, simply list the words you want to combine inside curly braces{} and separate them with commas. For example, let’s say you want to generate images of different cyberpunk, vaporwave, and art deco animals. You couldtype /imagine a {cyberpunk, vaporwave, art deco} {cat, dog} and Midjourney will generate six (3 * 2 = 6) different images:  /imagine a cyberpunk cat /imagine a vaporwave cat /imagine a art deco cat /imagine a cyberpunk dog /imagine a vaporwave dog /imagine a art deco dogYou can even nest curly braces inside other curly braces but be careful around the usage of it. For example, you couldtype /imagine A {sculpture, painting} of a {seagull {on a pier, on a beach}, poodle {on a sofa, in a truck}} andMidjourney will generate eight different images:  /imagine A sculpture of a seagull on a pier /imagine A sculpture of a seagull on a beach /imagine A sculpture of a poodle on a sofa /imagine A sculpture of a poodle in a truck /imagine A painting of a seagull on a pier /imagine A painting of a seagull on a beach /imagine A painting of a poodle on a sofa /imagine A painting of a poodle in a truckPermutations Feature Examples::    /imagine a {dark, bright} {city, town, village} at {night, dawn, sunset}: This command will generate 18 different imageswith various combinations of darkness and time of day.     /imagine a {blue, green, yellow, red} {bird, butterfly,dragonfly}: This command will generate 12 different images with different combinations of colors and creatures.     /imaginea {rustic, modern} {kitchen, bathroom} with a {wooden, marble} countertop: This command will generate 4 different imageswith different styles of kitchens or bathrooms and countertops.  The Permutations feature is a game-changer for artists and designers who want to quickly generate a large number ofimages with different variations. It’s perfect for creating series or collections of images with a common theme. These examples demonstrate how the Repeat and Permutations features can be used to quickly generate a large number ofimages with varying parameters. With the Repeat feature, users can generate multiple copies of the same image with justone command, while the Permutations feature allows users to create many unique images with different combinations ofwords. Conclusion: Overall, these new features add significant functionality to Midjourney and make it an even more powerful tool forgenerating AI-generated art.

In this blog post, we will dive into how the /describe command works and explore the ways in which it can beused to create compelling AI-generated art. In this tutorial we will learn about how to use /describe command in midjourney to get prompts for the images.  Prompt to image and image to prompt are both possible with midjourney now.

Let’s get started!! Midjourney describe command: Until now, midjourney can create images from prompts using natural language or keywords. The /describe command is a newfeature on Midjourney that allows users to upload an image and get four text prompts that try to describe the image. Theoutput of the describe command is a set of text prompts that describe the image approximately. These prompts can then beused to generate images that are related to the original image, but with unique twists and variations. The /describecommand is a powerful tool that can be used to generate a wide range of AI-generated art, from abstract pieces torealistic depictions of objects and scenes. How does the describe command work in midjourney: To use the /describe command, users simply need to type /describe followed by an image upload. Midjourney will thengenerate four text prompts that try to describe the image. These prompts are designed to be open-ended and allow for awide range of interpretations. Some examples of prompts generated by the /describe command might include. Here is a step by step process: Step 1: Enter /describe in discord chat:: Once you are inside the discord chat, enter /describe command and press EnterHere is a sample output image: Step 2: Upload image: Now upload the image that you want to describe by either drag and drop the image on to the window or by clicking on the image upload box. Here is how upload image looks like: Once you upload the image press Enter or Send the message.  Step 3: Progress &amp; output: Once the prompt is entered, image will be uploaded on to discord and sent to midjourney. Midjourney then takes sometime to process the image. When the image process happens the output looks like below: Once the reponse is received from midjourney, you can see the output as shown below. As part of the output you will receive 4 different prompts that closely describes what is given in the input image.  For the example image uploaded, the ouput received is:    an artistic illustration of mountains and cloud with a lake and waterfall, in the style of intricate psychedeliclandscapes, spherical sculptures, dark cyan and maroon, martin ansin, colorful, eye-catching compositions, victormoscoso, light cyan and amber     an artwork of a waterfall in some mountains, in the style of psychedelic graphic design, spherical sculptures, darkcrimson and aquamarine, colorful landscapes, detailed illustrations, vibrant color fields, lightbox     an image of an ocean and mountainside with a mountain, in the style of psychedelic illustration, sphericalsculptures, realistic color palette, detailed illustrations, dark cyan and maroon, illustration, landscapist     the landscape in the mountains has colorful mountain scenery, in the style of tristan eaton, psychedelicillustration, spherical sculptures, dark cyan and amber, illustration, luminosity of water, fine and detailed  Step 4: Generate variations:: Since you have prompt that is close enough to the original image, you can now generate your own variations of this image. To do that click on one of the buttons present below the output images in step 3 (i. e. 1,2,3,4 buttons). When you click send or enter, you might receive a warning that the prompt is being sent to midjourney. You can just press submit and the prompt will be sent to the serer.  This prompt is sent just like the regular /imagine prompt. After sometime you should 4 different variations of the prompt that you sent. Here is the output that is received after giving the prompt. As you can see this output is close enough to the input image that we originally gave.  Note that these images are created using Midjourney’s advanced AI algorithms and can be highly varied, evenwhen using the same prompt. Users can experiment with different combinations of prompts and images to create uniquepieces of AI-generated art that are unlike anything else on the web. How can the /describe command be used?: The /describe command is a versatile tool that can be used in a wide range of creative contexts. Some possible use cases for the /describe command might include: Creative Inspiration: One of the most obvious uses of the /describe command is as a source of creative inspiration. By uploading an image and generating text prompts that describe it, users can gain new insights into the image and explore new ways of representing it. The open-ended nature of the prompts means that there are countless possibilities for interpretation, which can lead to unexpected and exciting results. Content Creation: Another use case for the /describe command is as a tool for content creation. By using the prompts generated by the /describe command as a starting point, users can quickly and easily generate a wide range of images that are related to their original image. These images can be used as standalone pieces of art, or as part of larger creative projects such as graphic design or video production. Learning and Exploration: Finally, the /describe command can be used as a tool for learning and exploration. By experimenting with different combinations of prompts and images, users can gain a deeper understanding of how Midjourney’s AI algorithms work and how they can be used to generate unique and compelling art. This can be especially valuable for artists, designers, and other creative professionals who are interested in exploring new ways of working with AI-generated art. Conclusion: The /describe command is a powerful new feature on Midjourney that allows users to upload an image and generate fourtext prompts that try to describe it.

Logo for a Korean cosmetics brand, an image of a tree of different colors, a minimalist style   a squirrel chatting with ai bot How to create DALL-E or Bing image creator prompt: When generating prompts for DALL-E, it’s important to be as descriptive as possible. This means using specificadjectives, nouns, and verbs to create a clear mental image of what you want your AI-generated art to look like. You canalso include other details like locations, artistic styles, and moods to help DALL-E better understand your vision. Here is the exact template of how bing image creator prompt should look like:  [adjective] + [noun] + [verb] + [style] + other parameters like [mood] etc One example of a well-crafted prompt is “fuzzy creature wearing sunglasses, digital art. ” In this prompt, theadjective “fuzzy” and the noun “creature” help DALL-E understand that the image should feature a soft, animal-likebeing. The verb “wearing sunglasses” adds a unique detail to the image, making it stand out from more generic prompts. The addition of “digital art” as the style tells DALL-E to create an image that looks like a digital illustration,rather than a photograph or painting. Lastly, the mood “happy, bright” sets the tone for the image, suggesting a playfuland whimsical scene. By following this format of [adjective] [noun] [verb] [style] [mood], you can create prompts that are both creative anddescriptive, leading to more accurate and interesting AI-generated art.  Tips to create best prompts for DALL-E:    Be specific: The more specific your prompt is, the better. Instead of saying “bird,” try describing a “colorfulhummingbird sipping nectar from a flower. ” This helps DALL-E create a more accurate image.     Use descriptive words: Adjectives and adverbs can help add depth and detail to your prompts. Use words that describecolors, textures, emotions, and more to make your prompt more vivid.     Consider artistic styles: Think about the style of art you want DALL-E to create. Do you want a photorealistic image,or do you prefer something more abstract? Include the style you’re looking for in your prompt.     Add mood or emotion: Adding a specific mood or emotion to your prompt can help DALL-E create an image that evokes acertain feeling. For example, “dark and moody forest” versus “bright and sunny forest” will create two very differentimages.     Think outside the box: Don’t be afraid to get creative with your prompts. Instead of using generic descriptions, tryto come up with unique and unusual combinations of words. This can help DALL-E generate images that are trulyone-of-a-kind.  By following these tips and using our list of 200 prompts as inspiration, you’ll be well on your way to creatingstunning AI-generated art with DALL-E.

Let’s get started!! Midjourney tips for creative character prompts: Here are some of the practical tips to get best results out of midjourney prompts that involve characters, personas, movie actors or artists. 1. For creating animated midjourney characters, use the –niji mode. :  The Niji Journey and Niji Mode both pertain to the same generator, however, they are accessed differently.  Midjourney users have the option to switch to Niji Mode by appending “–niji” to their prompt when messaging the midjourney bot.  On the other hand, the Niji Journey is a Discord server with its own bot, the Niji Journey Bot, that can also generate outputs similar to Midjourney. Users can communicate with the Niji Journey Bot by using the same “–niji” command and prompt as they would with Midjourney. 2. Take advantage of midjourney v5 to describe characters: Midjourney v5 is great for natural language. In previous versions of midjourney (i. e. v4 and older) to get better outputwe need to stuff the prompt with keywords. But in v5 we can just describe in conversational english tone. So describecharacters as much as possible for best outputs. 3. Introduce new characters or environments: Mid-journey prompts can be a great way to introduce new characters or settings that challenge the character’sperspective. Think about how these new elements can change the character’s trajectory and create prompts that explorethese changes.  Example: Your character has been traveling alone for a while, but they stumble upon a small village in the middle of the forest. As they explore, they meet a group of people who are very different from anyone they’ve met before. Choose one of these new characters and write a scene where they challenge your main character’s beliefs or values. 4. Consider the character’s backstory: Think about the character’s past experiences and how they may have shaped who they are. Use this information to createprompts that challenge the character’s beliefs and force them to confront their inner demons. Example: Write a scene where the character visits a place from their childhood that holds happy memories. As theyrevisit this place, they reflect on how far they have come since those days and how much they have grown as a person. Use this moment of reflection to show how the character’s past experiences have shaped them into a stronger, moreresilient individual. 5. Think about the character’s goals: What does the character want? What are their motivations? Create prompts that test the character’s resolve and push themto go beyond their comfort zone. 6. Create moral dilemmas: A great way to challenge your character is to create moral dilemmas that force them to make tough decisions. Think aboutwhat values are important to your character and create prompts that put those values to the test. 7. Consider the character’s relationships: Relationships can be a powerful tool for character development. Create prompts that explore the character’srelationships with other characters and how those relationships evolve over time. 8. Use the environment to your advantage: Use the environment as a tool for creating prompts that challenge your character. Think about how the environment canimpact the character’s emotional state and use that to create prompts that push them to their limits. 9. Give the character a new skill or challenge: Mid-journey prompts can be a great way to introduce new skills or challenges that the character must overcome. Thinkabout what skills or challenges would be most relevant to the character’s journey and create prompts that focus on thoseareas.

    "title": "Bard vs ChatGPT comparison: What is the difference",
    "body": "2023/03/22 - IntroductionGoogle introduced Bard, an AI (artificial intelligence) chatbot that caninteract with human beings in the form of chat conversations. ChatGPT was introduced by OpenAI which interacts in aconversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes,challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. At a high level Bard is a chatbot built on top of LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications), a conversational AI model capable of fluid, multi-turn dialogue, whereas ChatGPT is built on top of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT-3) as its underlying technology. In this tutorial we will dive into some of the differences between Google Bard AI vs ChatGPT in various aspects. Let’s get started. Google Bard AI vs ChatGPT Comparison: Here is the comparison across various properties for each of these languages. 1. Real time information: Bard: Bard AI has a unique advantage over ChatGPT in this case as it can access real-time information from Google. With thiscapability, Bard can provide accurate and relevant answers to users’ questions based on the latest available data. You can give Bard a latest url in 2023 and ask for summary of it. Here is an example. ChatGPT: Compared to Bard, ChatGPT has a limitation in that its training data is cut off at September 2021. This means that itmay not be able to provide accurate or current information for questions related to recent events or trends. As aresult, we might need to seek out other sources for up-to-date information. 2. Context retention: Holding context refers to the ability to remember information that has been previously discussed in a conversation. Thisis important for language models because it allows them to respond more naturally and to understand the full meaning ofwhat is being said. Bard: Bard’s ability to hold context is purposefully limited for now because it is still under development. As Bard learnsmore about the world and how to communicate with humans, its ability to hold context will improve. This will allow Bardto have longer, more meaningful conversations with humans. When you open bard. google. com you end up with a fresh screen with fresh context. There is no option to continueconversation from where you left. ChatGPT: ChatGPT is able to remember what was said in previous conversations. In ChatGPT UI, you can start a “New Chat” for everyconversation. Each chat tab has its own context and ChatGPT can continue the conversation from where its left for eachchat tab. Only caveat is that it can only remember up to 3,000 words (anything beyond that isn’t stored), and it doesn’tuse past conversation to form responses. 3. Input and Output Limits:: Bard: The exact limits of how many tokens of text Bard can give in input and output are not publicly available, but it islikely to be in the range of 100,000 to 1,000,000 tokens. Some users reported Bard has an input limit of around 4,000letters or approximately 1,000 tokens. The output limit is still being tested, but it’s clear that there are constraintson the length of its responses. ChatGPT: ChatGPT on the other hand has around 16,000 characters, approximately, ~4,000 tokens. This enables it to handle longerinputs and generate more extensive outputs. If response goes beyond this limit it gets cut abruptly. 4. Performance: Bard: For complex queries, Bard still lacks lot of training and development. Its good for general purpose use cases. But for complex cases such as programming etc need more development. ChatGPT: ChatGPT has an edge in this context for complex tasks. It can give decent responses for coding questions and complex comprehensive questions. 5. Language support: Bard: Bard is currently able to translate text into a limited number of languages i. e. English. It is stillunder development and improving its ability to translate into other languages. ChatGPT: ChatGPT on the other hand has some multilingual capabilities including spanish, fresh etc. But it also has limitations in languagesupport. However, it outperforms Bard in the aforementioned languages. Conclusion: In conclusion, both Google Bard and ChatGPT are AI chatbots designed to interact with humans in a conversational manner. Bard is built on top of LaMDA, while ChatGPT is built on top of GPT-3. 5-turbo. While both chatbots have theirsimilarities, they also have their differences in terms of the technology behind them, their capabilities, and theirlimitations. Ultimately, the choice between the two chatbots will depend on the specific needs and preferences of theuser. Regardless of the chatbot chosen, it is evident that AI chatbots are becoming increasingly sophisticated and arerevolutionizing the way we interact with technology. "

    "title": "ChatGPT Response cut off - How to Deal with Truncated Conversations and code blocks",
    "body": "2023/03/05 - Introduction:: ChatGPT is a powerful conversational AI tool that can provide insightful and informative responses to a wide range ofprompts. There are plenty of applications of Chatgpt like generating prompts for midjourney AI art or you use it for writing resumes etc. However, like any technology, there are limits to what it can do. One of the most common issues that usersencounter is ChatGPT response cut off i. e. chat gpt just truncates the response abruptly. In this blog post, we’llexplore what causes ChatGPT responses to get truncated, how to deal with truncated conversations, and best practices foroptimizing your interactions with this tool.  Chat gpt response limits &amp; causes for response Cut Off: There are a few reasons why ChatGPT responses can get cut off. One of the most common causes is input length. ChatGPTinput has a limit of 2048 tokens, which means that if your prompt exceeds this limit, the response may get truncated. Additionally, ChatGPT response has a limit of 512 tokens for output (i. e. roughly 4096 character limit). So if theoutput crosses this limit chatgpt response stops abruptly. Another factor that can contribute to ChatGPT response cut off is the complexity of the prompt. If the prompt is toocomplex or difficult to understand, ChatGPT may have trouble generating a coherent response, which could result in atruncated conversation. This is one of the reasons chatgpt response time could vary. How to continue truncated chatgpt conversation &amp; Code blocks ?: If you encounter a truncated conversation with ChatGPT, there are a few solutions you can follow. 1: Ask chat gpt to continue conversation: If your chat gpt response got cut off in the middle you can just say Please continue or continueor continue from your previous response prompt to pick up where the previous response left off. This can be especially useful if the response includes a long form content for eg: a long blog post or a long bookgeneration. The more specific you are , the better results you will get. Here is much more specific example to continueprevious response. “Could you finish the example you gave in the second paragraph of your previous response?” 2: Ask chatgpt to continue from specific line or context for code blocks: Solution 1 works best if the response is a regular paragraph or long form output. But if you expect chatgpt to give acode block as the response, saying continue might have inconsistent code format. In these cases the best way to deal with truncated chatgpt response code blocks is to make reference to specific partsof the code block or formatting in your request to continue the response. For example, you could say something like “Please continue your previous response starting from line 10 of the codeblock. make sure to continue in the same code format like your previous repsonse” or“Could you finish the example you gave in the second paragraph of your previous response?” This will help chatgpt tounderstand which part of the previous response you are referring to and where to pick up from. 3: Ask chatgpt to give responses with page numbers at each prompt: The other approach that works in many cases is to ask chatgpt upfrom to break the output response in the form of pages. Here is an example: Example: 12345You: Give me 100 interview tips for coding interview. Give response in pages of 1 to 10. Page 1ChatGPT: . . . . . . You: Page 2ChatGPT: . . . . . Check out the screenshot for example: Alternatively, you could specify a word or character limit for each section of the response. For example, you could saysomething like: “Could you please provide your explanation in sections of no more than 100 words each?” By giving it clear instructions on how you would like the response structured, it can tailor the answer to better meetyour needs and ensure that it’s easier for you to understand and follow along. 4. Simplify the prompt as much as possible:: Another option is to try simplifying your prompt. By making the prompt easier to understand and parse, you may be ableto avoid triggering the input or output limits. Additionally, you can try breaking your prompt up into smaller piecesand running multiple interactions with ChatGPT to generate a longer response. If you don’t ask specific questions,ChatGPT provides general responses. So asking specific questions in chunks is a great practise for chatgpt. Summary of best practises:: To avoid ChatGPT response cut off and ensure optimal performance, there are a few best practices you should follow. First, keep your prompts as clear and concise as possible, while still providing enough context for ChatGPT to generatean informative response. Second, consider breaking up longer prompts into smaller pieces and running multipleinteractions. Third, be mindful of the input and output limits, and avoid exceeding them whenever possible.

    "title": "Golang read file line by line - 3 Simple ways",
    "body": "2023/02/24 - Welcome back to our Golang tutorial series! In other Golang posts, we covered about Golang get map keys - 3 Simple ways 3 simple ways to get the first character of a string in Golang Golang get last element of slice / array / list - Simple and fast Golang enums implementation with examples Golang sets implementation in 2 simple ways Golang for loops: 5 basic ways with examples using range, arrays, maps iteration In this post, we’ll be discussing another important topic - how to read a file line by line in Golang. Reading a fileline by line is a common task in programming, and Golang provides several ways to accomplish this. We’ll be exploring 3simple methods using the “bufio”, “ioutil”, and “os” packages. Let’s dive in! 1: Using ioutil ReadFile: Here’s an example code snippet that demonstrates how to read a file line by line using the “ioutil” package: The second method uses the “ioutil” package to read a file line by line. This method reads the entire contents of a fileinto memory using the “ioutil. ReadFile” function. The contents of the file are returned as a byte slice, which can beconverted to a string using the “string” function. The string can then be split into lines using the “strings. Split”function with the “\n” delimiter. This method is simple and straightforward, but it may not be suitable for large filesthat cannot be read entirely into memory. 123456789101112131415161718192021package mainimport (   fmt    io/ioutil    log    strings )func main() {  data, err := ioutil. ReadFile( example. txt )  if err != nil {    log. Fatal(err)  }  lines := strings. Split(string(data),  \n )  for _, line := range lines {    fmt. Println(line)  }}In this example, we first read the entire file “example. txt” into memory using the “ioutil. ReadFile” function. We thensplit the byte slice into lines using the “strings. Split” function with the “\n” delimiter and print each line usingthe “fmt. Println” function. 2: Using bufio Scanner: The first method uses the “bufio” package to read a file line by line. This method creates a new scanner using the “bufio. NewScanner” function, which takes a file as an argument. The scanner provides a convenient way to read thecontents of a file line by line using the “scanner. Scan” method. This method returns a boolean value indicating whethera line was successfully scanned or not, and the line itself can be obtained using the “scanner. Text” method. If an erroroccurs during scanning, the “scanner. Err” method can be used to retrieve it. Here’s an example code snippet that demonstrates how to read a file line by line using the “bufio” package: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627package mainimport (   bufio    fmt    log    os )func main() {  file, err := os. Open( example. txt )  if err != nil {    log. Fatal(err)  }  defer file. Close()  scanner := bufio. NewScanner(file)  for scanner. Scan() {    line := scanner. Text()    fmt. Println(line)  }  if err := scanner. Err(); err != nil {    log. Fatal(err)  }}In this example, we first open the file “example. txt” using the “os. Open” function and create a new scanner using the “bufio. NewScanner” function. We then use a for loop to read each line of the file using the “scanner. Scan” method andprint it using the “fmt. Println” function. Finally, we check for any errors using the “scanner. Err” method. 3: Using os Open and bufio NewReader: The third method uses the “os” and “bufio” packages to read a file line by line. This method opens the file using the “os. Open” function and creates a new buffered reader using the “bufio. NewReader” function. The reader provides aconvenient way to read the contents of a file line by line using the “reader. ReadString” method. This method reads astring up to the specified delimiter, which in this case is the newline character ‘\n’. If an error occurs duringreading, the loop can be exited. This method is also simple and straightforward, and it is suitable for reading largefiles since it reads the file contents in chunks rather than reading the entire file into memory. Here’s an example code snippet that demonstrates how to read a file line by line using the “os” and “bufio” packages: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526package mainimport (   bufio    fmt    log    os )func main() {  file, err := os. Open( example. txt )  if err != nil {    log. Fatal(err)  }  defer file. Close()  reader := bufio. NewReader(file)  for {    line, err := reader. ReadString('\n')    if err != nil {      break    }    fmt. Print(line)  }}In this example, we first open the file “example. txt” using the “os. Open” function and create a new buffered readerusing the “bufio. NewReader” function. We then use a for loop to read each line of the file using the “reader. ReadString”method and print it using the “fmt. Print” function. Finally, we check for any errors and break out of the loop if theend of the file is reached. Conclusion: In conclusion, reading a file line by line is an essential task in Golang programming, and there are several ways toaccomplish this. In this post, we discussed 3 simple methods using the “bufio”, “ioutil”, and “os” packages. Dependingon the specific requirements of your project, one method may be more suitable than the others.

    "title": "3 simple ways to get the first character of a string in Golang",
    "body": "2023/02/24 - In Golang, working with strings is a common task in many programming scenarios. Often, we need to extract or manipulate a certain character from a string, and the first character is one such example. Getting the first character of a string may seem like a trivial task, but it can be done in multiple ways in Golang. In this blog post, we will explore three simple ways to accomplish this task using built-in functions and methods in the Go programming language. By the end of this article, you will have a good understanding of these methods and be able to choose the one that best suits your needs. these methods in detail. In case you missed it check out other Golang articles here Golang read file line by line - 3 Simple ways Golang get last element of slice / array / list - Simple and fast Golang get map keys - 3 Simple ways Golang enums implementation with examples Golang sets implementation in 2 simple ways Golang for loops: 5 basic ways with examples using range, arrays, maps iteration Simple HTTP server with java socket programming So, let’s dive in and explore the 3 simple ways to get the first character of a string in Golang. 1. Use the index position to access the string characters: One way to get the first character of a string in Golang is to use the index position of the first character, which is 0. We can access a character in a string by its index position using the square bracket notation. To get the first character of a string, we can simply use the index position 0. For example, if we have a string “hello”, we can get the first character “h” by using “string[0]”. Here’s an example code snippet: 1234567891011package mainimport  fmt func main() {	str :=  This is a string from TipSeason. com 	fmt. Printf( %c , str[0])}Output:$ go run example. goTIn the above code snippet, we have declared a string “This is a string from TipSeason. com” and used the index position 0to access the first character of the string. We have then converted the byte value to a string using the “string”keyword. Finally, we have printed the first character “T” using the “fmt. Printf” function. This method is simple and straightforward, but we need to be careful to ensure that the string is not empty beforeaccessing the first character to avoid runtime errors. 2. Use a slice expression on a string to get the section of the string that you want: Another way to get the first character of a string in Golang is to use a slice expression to extract a section of thestring that we want. A slice expression is a way to extract a portion of a string by specifying a starting and endingindex. To get the first character of a string using a slice expression, we can specify the starting index as 0 and the endingindex as 1. This will extract a section of the string containing only the first character. Here’s an example code snippet: 1234567891011package mainimport  fmt func main() {  str :=  This is a string from TipSeason. com   fmt. Printf(str[0:1])}Output:$ go run example. goTIn the above code snippet, we have declared a string “This is a string from TipSeason. com” and used a slice expressionto extract a section of the string containing only the first character. The slice expression [0:1] specifies thestarting index as 0 and the ending index as 1, which will extract a section of the string containing only the firstcharacter. Finally, we have printed the first character “T” using the “fmt. Printf” function. This method is also simple and easy to understand. It doesn’t require us to know the length of the string or the indexposition of the first character. However, it does require us to use a slice expression, which may not be familiar tosome programmers who are new to Golang. 3. Use the string() function to convert a string to a slice of bytes. : The third way to get the first character of a string in Golang is to use the “string()” function to convert a string toa slice of bytes. Once we have the slice of bytes, we can access the first byte using the index position 0 and convertit back to a string using the “string()” function. Here’s an example code snippet: 123456789101112package mainimport  fmt func main() {	str :=  This is a string from TipSeason. com 	fmt. Printf( %c , string(str)[0])}Output:$ go run example. goTNote that the first two methods work on ASCII characters, while the third method works on all characters. In the above code snippet, we have declared a string “This is a string from TipSeason. com” and used the “string()”function to convert it to a slice of bytes. We have then accessed the first byte of the slice using the index position 0and converted it back to a string using the “string()” function. We have then printed the first character “T” usingthe “fmt. Printf” function. This method is not straightforward, but the advantage is that first two methods work on ASCIIcharacters. While the third method worls for all characters. Conclusion: In conclusion, we have explored three simple ways to get the first character of a string in Golang. These methodsinclude using the index position, using a slice expression, and using the “string()” function. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the best method to use will depend on the specific requirements ofyour programming scenario.

    "title": "Using ChatGPT Like a Pro: Tips and Tricks for Accurate Answers",
    "body": "2023/02/05 - How Not to Use OpenAI’s ChatGPT: Tips and Examples: OpenAI’s ChatGPT is a powerful language model that has the ability to respond to various types of prompts in a natural and human-like manner. However, it’s important to understand how to use ChatGPT effectively to ensure accurate and relevant answers. In this blog post, we’ll cover the most common mistakes people make when using ChatGPT and provide tips on how to avoid them. 1. Vague or Ambiguous Prompts: One of the biggest mistakes people make when using ChatGPT is asking vague or ambiguous prompts. When a prompt is too general or lacks context, ChatGPT can become confused and provide an incorrect or irrelevant answer. For example, if you ask, “What’s the weather today?” without specifying a location, ChatGPT won’t be able to provide an accurate answer. The correct way to ask this question would be, “What’s the weather like in New York City today?” This prompt is specific and provides enough context for ChatGPT to understand the request. 2. Complex Questions: Another common mistake is asking ChatGPT complex questions that require in-depth analysis or scientific knowledge. ChatGPT is designed to provide simple and straightforward answers, so it’s best to avoid asking questions that are too complex. For example, if you ask, “What are the effects of quantum entanglement on the formation of black holes in the universe?” you may not get a clear answer because the topic is too complex for ChatGPT to fully understand. Instead, try asking more specific and concise questions, such as, “What is quantum entanglement?” or “What is a black hole?” 3. Lack of Context: ChatGPT needs enough context to understand what you’re asking and provide an accurate answer. If you don’t provide enough information, ChatGPT may not understand what you’re looking for. For example, if you ask, “What’s the capital of France?” without any additional context, ChatGPT will likely respond with “Paris. ” However, if you’re asking about a different France, such as the French Guiana, the capital would be Cayenne. It’s important to provide enough context so ChatGPT can understand the request and provide an accurate answer. 4. Unclear Language: Using unclear language or phrases with multiple meanings can also lead to confusion and incorrect answers from ChatGPT. To avoid this, it’s important to use clear and specific language when asking questions. For example, if you ask, “What’s the name of the thing you put on a wall to hang stuff?” it may be unclear what you’re referring to. Instead, use clear and specific language, such as, “What is the name of the item used to hang things on a wall?” 5. Requesting Personal Opinion: Finally, it’s important to understand that ChatGPT is an AI language model and does not have personal opinions. If you ask ChatGPT questions that require personal opinions, such as, “What do you think about the current political situation?” it will not be able to provide an answer. In conclusion, using ChatGPT effectively requires clear and specific prompts, enough context, and avoiding vague or ambiguous language. By following these tips and avoiding the common mistakes listed above, you can ensure accurate and relevant answers from ChatGPT. "

    "title": "PostgreSQL Vs MySQL differences in syntax - A developer guide",
    "body": "2022/09/01 - Introduction: PostgreSQL and MySQL are widely used databases by major companies across multiple projects, given the amount of scale andperformance these databases can handle. Many developers work on these two important databases when transitioning todifferent projects or different companies. When we get used to one database for example MySQL and then transition toanother database say PostgresSQL or viceversa, then we tend to use the same commands across each other. However, syntaxfor postgres and mysql is slightly different. In this tutorial we will compare and understand the differences between PostgreSQL and MySQL in terms of syntax for various operations or queries that are frequently used in production systems. For the purpose of this tutorial we use psql and mysql clients for showcasing examples. As a quick recap,psql is a terminal based client for PostgreSQL. We can connect to PostgreSQL server with psql and perform different operations. mysql is a terminal based client for MySQL. We can connect to MySQL server with mysql and perform different operations. So let’s get started. 1. Show a list of all databases: As part of setup, we have created a database named demo (using create database demo) upfront in both PostgreSQL andMySQL. To show a list of all databases present in PostgreSQL or MySQL, we can use the below commands: List or show databases in Postgres or psql:Default databases in most PostgreSQL servers are template0 , template0, postgres. To list all the databases in Postgres i. e. psql we can use : \lExample in psql client: For our tutorial, you can see database demo is listed in the below example. 1234567891011postgres=# \l                  List of databases  Name  |   Owner   | Encoding |  Collate  |  Ctype  |  Access privileges  -----------+---------------+----------+-------------+-------------+----------------------- demo   | demouser   | UTF8   | en_US. UTF-8 | en_US. UTF-8 | postgres | postgres   | UTF8   | en_US. UTF-8 | en_US. UTF-8 | template0 | postgres   | UTF8   | en_US. UTF-8 | en_US. UTF-8 | =c/postgres     +      |        |     |       |       | postgres=CTc/postgres template1 | postgres   | UTF8   | en_US. UTF-8 | en_US. UTF-8 | =c/postgres     +      |        |     |       |       | postgres=CTc/postgres(4 rows)List or show databases in MySQL:Default databases in most MySQL servers are information_schema , performance_schema, mysql, sys In MySQL to show list of all databases we can use: show databasesExample in mysql client: For our tutorial, you can see database demo is listed in the below example. 1234567891011mysql&gt; show databases;+--------------------+| Database      |+--------------------+| demo        || information_schema || mysql       || performance_schema || sys        |+--------------------+5 rows in set (0. 01 sec)MySQL show databases is equivalent to PostgreSQL list (\l) databases. 2. Use or Change database: If you have multiple databases on your DB server, we often need to switch between multiple databases to performvarious DDL or DML operations or to read data. In order to change or use a different database than the currently selected database, wecan use the below queries. Change or Use database in PostgreSQL:To change the database in PostgreSQL we can use : \c {dbname}   \c {dbname} : Switches the current database to the specified database in PostgreSQLNote: Text in curly braces can to be replaced with your own data. Don’t forget to remove the braces. See example below. 12postgres-# \c demoYou are now connected to database  demo  as user  demouser . Use or Change database in MySQL:To change the database in MySQL we can use : use {dbname}   use {dbname} : Switches the current database to the specified database in MySQLExample: 123mysql&gt; use demo;Database changedmysql&gt; 3. Show schemas: Schema is like a namespace of database objects such as tables, views, indexes etc. Depending on the type of DB server, a database can contain multiple schemas, but a schema belongs to only one database. In some DB servers, schema and database are used synonymously. Show schemas in PostgreSQL:PostgreSQL supports having multiple schemas in a single database so that you can specify different namespace fordifferent features.   \dn : Shows list of schemas in PostgreSQLExample: 123456postgres=# \dn List of schemas Name | Owner  --------+---------- public | postgres(1 row)Show schemas in MySQL:In MySQL a schema is similar or synonymous with a database. You can substitute the keyword SCHEMA instead of DATABASE in MySQL SQL syntax, for example using CREATE SCHEMA instead of CREATE DATABASE.   show schemas : Shows list of schemas in MySQLExample: 1234567891011mysql&gt; show schemas;+--------------------+| Database      |+--------------------+| demo        || information_schema || mysql       || performance_schema || sys        |+--------------------+5 rows in set (0. 02 sec)4. Show a list of all tables: Once we change to the desired database, one of the most frequently used operations is to list all the tables that are present in the current database. List or show tables PostgreSQL:To show the list of tables in PostgreSQL, we can use \dt or \dt+ or \d or \d+   \dt or \d : Gives list of tables in current database   \dt+ or \d+: Gives list of tables in current database with additional information like Size, description etc. star Pro Tip: In postgres/psql, many commands support + as part of the syntax. Eg: Try \dt+ instead of \dt . If we use + , we can see additional information for that specific command. Example: For this example two tables demo_table_primarykey (with primary key) and demo_table (without primary key) are already created for demo purposes. 12345678910111213141516demo-# \dt          List of relations Schema |     Name     | Type |   Owner   --------+-----------------------+-------+--------------- public | demo_table      | table | demouser public | demo_table_primarykey | table | demouser(2 rows)demo-# \dt+                       List of relations Schema |     Name     | Type |   Owner   | Persistence | Access method | Size  | Description --------+-----------------------+-------+---------------+-------------+---------------+---------+------------- public | demo_table      | table | demouser | permanent  | heap     | 0 bytes | public | demo_table_primarykey | table | demouser | permanent  | heap     | 0 bytes | (2 rows)List or show tables MySQL:Once we select current database with use demo , to show the list of tables in MySQL, we can use show tables   show tables Gives list of tables in current database for mysql123456789mysql&gt; show tables;+-----------------------+| Tables_in_demo    |+-----------------------+| demo_table      || demo_table_primarykey |+-----------------------+2 rows in set (0. 00 sec)5. Describe table: Now that we know how to list all the tables, let’s focus on specific table. If we have to describe the table fields, index etc, we can use the below queries. Describe table in PostgreSQL:To describe a table in PostgreSQL, we can use : \dt {table_name} or \dt+ {table_name}Alternatively \d {table_name} or \d+ {table_name} can also be used with each of the queries resulting in slightly different columns.   \dt {table_name} Gives basic information about specific table  \dt+ {table_name} Gives additional information about specific table  \d+ {table_name} Gives index level details too for more specific information. (Preferred way) Example: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223demo=# \d+ demo_table_primarykey;                 Table  public. demo_table_primarykey  Column | Type  | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage | Compression | Stats target | Description --------+---------+-----------+----------+---------+---------+-------------+--------------+------------- id   | integer |      | not null |     | plain  |       |       | Indexes:   demo_table_primarykey_pkey  PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)Access method: heapdemo=# \dt demo_table_primarykey;          List of relations Schema |     Name     | Type |   Owner   --------+-----------------------+-------+--------------- public | demo_table_primarykey | table | demouser(1 row)demo=# \dt+ demo_table_primarykey;                       List of relations Schema |     Name     | Type |   Owner   | Persistence | Access method | Size  | Description --------+-----------------------+-------+---------------+-------------+---------------+---------+------------- public | demo_table_primarykey | table | demouser | permanent  | heap     | 0 bytes | (1 row)Describe table in MySQL:In MySQL, to describe a table we can use desc {table_name} or describe {table_name} for detailed table information.   describe {table_name} Gives full information about specific tableExample below: 1234567mysql&gt; describe table demo_table_primarykey;+----+-------------+-----------------------+------------+-------+---------------+---------+---------+------+------+----------+-------------+| id | select_type | table         | partitions | type | possible_keys | key   | key_len | ref | rows | filtered | Extra    |+----+-------------+-----------------------+------------+-------+---------------+---------+---------+------+------+----------+-------------+| 1 | SIMPLE   | demo_table_primarykey | NULL    | index | NULL     | PRIMARY | 4    | NULL |  1 |  100. 00 | Using index |+----+-------------+-----------------------+------------+-------+---------------+---------+---------+------+------+----------+-------------+1 row in set, 1 warning (0. 00 sec)6. Show create table: If we want to see how the table is created or detailed indexes etc, MySQL has a convenient way to show the exact table structure. But in PostgreSQL there is no straight forward way to see it. But here are some alternatives. Show create table in PostgreSQL:Since there is no inbuilt query to show how table is created, we can use \d+ {table_name} like we discussed in the list table section to view the detailed table info. If we want the exact table structure we can rely on pg_dump utility which is originally an export schema/data utility of postgres. We can leverage the schema dump mechanism from that.   pg_dump -st {table_name} {dbname} Dumps the exact table DDL Show create table in MySQL:In MySQL, in order to see how the table is created, we can use   show create table {table_name} Shows the exact DDL that is used to create the table1234567891011mysql&gt; show create table demo_table_primarykey;+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+| Table         | Create Table                                                                    |+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+| demo_table_primarykey | CREATE TABLE `demo_table_primarykey` ( `id` int NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`)) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci |+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+1 row in set (0. 01 sec)7. Show list of users or roles: To view the list of users or roles in PostgreSQL vs MySQL we can use the below syntax. List users or roles in PostgreSQL:Detailed of information of users and roles can be obtained from \du   \du Shows the list of roles and their attributes in PostgreSQL123456demo=# \du                   List of roles  Role name  |             Attributes             | Member of ---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+----------- postgres   | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {} demouser | Superuser, Create role, Create DB             | {}Show all users or roles in MySQL:In MySQL mysql. user table gives detailed information about various users, roles and their properties. To get user and their host you can use below query. Optionally try DESCRIBE mysql. user to see full list of supported attributes.   SELECT User, Host from mysql. user; Shows the list of roles and their attributes in MySQL1234567891011mysql&gt; SELECT User, Host from mysql. user;+------------------+-----------+| User       | Host   |+------------------+-----------+| mysql. infoschema | localhost || mysql. session  | localhost || mysql. sys    | localhost || demouser       | localhost |+------------------+-----------+4 rows in set (0. 00 sec)8. Show process list: If you have a slow query or you want to view the list of current running process list, we can use the below queries. Show process list in PostgreSQL:To show process list in PostgreSQL, we can rely on pg_stat_activity table. This table has very useful information about currently running activities on the database.   select * from pg_stat_activity Gives the detailed list of processes in PostgreSQLExample: 123456postgres=# select * from pg_stat_activity; datid | datname | pid | leader_pid | usesysid |  usename  | application_name | client_addr | client_hostname | client_port |     backend_start     |     xact_start      |     query_start     |     state_change     | wait_event_type |   wait_event   | state | backend_xid | backend_xmin | query_id |       query       |     backend_type     -------+----------+-------+------------+----------+---------------+------------------+-------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------+---------------------+--------+-------------+--------------+----------+---------------------------------+------------------------------    |     | 1855 |      |     |        |         |       |         |       | 2022-06-17 17:30:34. 569684-07 |                |                |                | Activity    | AutoVacuumMain   |    |       |       |     |                 | autovacuum launcher    |     | 1857 |      |    10 | postgres   |         |       |         |       | 2022-06-17 17:30:34. 574222-07 |                |                |                | Activity    | LogicalLauncherMain |    |       |       |     |                 | logical replication launcheronly some datashown for example purposesShow process list in MySQL:To show process list in MySQL you can use : show processlist   show processlist Gives the detailed list of processes in MySQLExample: 1234567mysql&gt; show processlist;+----+-----------------+-----------+------+---------+-------+------------------------+------------------+| Id | User      | Host   | db  | Command | Time | State         | Info       |+----+-----------------+-----------+------+---------+-------+------------------------+------------------+| 5 | event_scheduler | localhost | NULL | Daemon | 65151 | Waiting on empty queue | NULL       || 8 | demouser      | localhost | demo | Query  |   0 | init          | show processlist |+----+-----------------+-As you can see from the above comparison, each database is different and the way you can get information from thesedatabases change a bit. So bookmark and share this post to ease your day-to-day development. 9. Comments, Quotes, Case sensitivty: There are some basic differences between PostgreSQL VS MySQL in terms of comments, quotes, case sensitivity. Lets check them here. Comments: Single line comments in PostgreSQL can be added using: -- Single line comments in MySQL can be added using: #Handling Quotes: PosgreSQL support only single quote (') character for strings. Example: WHERE site = 'tipseason. com' MySQL supports both single quote (') and double quote ( ) characters for strings. Example: WHERE site = 'tipseason. com' or WHERE site =  tipseason. com Case sensitivity: PosgreSQL is case-sensitive. Example: WHERE site = 'tipseason. com' might give different results than WHERE site = 'TipSeason. com' . We can use case conversion like (lower , upper etc. ) and compare the objects.  MySQL is case-insensitive. So in above example both queries gives same results. PostgreSQL vs MySQL differences side by side: Here is a quick side by side comparison between PostgreSQL vs MySQL in syntax.       Property    PostgreSQL    MySQL        Show list of databases    \l    show databases        Use database    \c {db_name}    use {db_name}        Show list of schemas    \dn    show schemas        Show list of tables    \d or \d+ or \dt or \dt+    show tables        Describe table    \dt {table_name} or \d+ {table_name}    describe {table_name}        Show create table    pg_dump -st {table_name} {dbname}    show create table {table_name}         Show list of users or roles    \du    SELECT User, Host from mysql. user;         Show process list    select * from pg_stat_activity    show processlist        Comment single line    -- (double dash)    # (hash)         String quotes    Only supports single quote (') eg:`where name = 'TipSeason'`     Supports both single(') and double quotes ( ) eg: `where name =  TipSeason `         Case sensitivity    Postgres is case sensitive eg: `WHERE name = 'TipSeason'` gives different results than `WHERE name = 'tipseason'`     MySQL is case insensitive.

    "title": "25+ Coding post types - Ideas for trending tech blogs",
    "body": "2022/09/01 - When we want to write our tech blogs either as a profession or a hobby, sometimes we might get stuck on few questions like  What type of coding post or programming post we need to write next ? What are the pros and cons of specific coding post types Any example references for them ?To answer these questions, in this tutorial we will learn about 25+ coding post types / ideas along with examples that you can implement in your next trending article. Let’s get started. There are many types of programming posts people blog about. Here are the best ones to include in your next programming post. 1. Listicles: Listicles are the articles written in list format. Best example for this is the post that you are reading right now 15 Coding post ideas is a listicle. It has list of 25+ ideas where each of them can be explained individually while covering the whole topic.  Listicles are great for SEO (Search engine optimization) i. e. they can rank better on Google or other search engines. One of the reasons for this is that they can be featured by google snippets. Check the example snippet that google ranks for one of the listicle coding post.    As you can see in the screenshot, since the article is in a list format, google tries to give answer the search query as an instant answer which in turn helps rank our blog to be on top of google list.     Other advantage of listicles is that they are great for affiliate marketing. For example if a listicle is about top 10 books to buy, then each book can have its own affiliate link that you can add in content contextually.     Some cons of listicles are that it can be time consuming to collect the lists depending on how complex the list is. So keep that in mind when picking a listicle topic.  Examples: Top 10 most loved programming languages of 2022 Top 10 Cloud Service Providers Globally in 2022 2. Text based Courses: Video and text are two powerful ways to learn something. Lot of people take video courses to learn new things. Interestingly many people prefer text based courses as opposed to video. Reason being that videos can be time consuming to watch.  Since each of us read at our own speed, text based courses can save a lot of time compared to video. So if you plan to create a video course of if you have one already or want to start some course, try to write a text based course too. This save a lot of time and can act as input to video courses. Example: educative. io has popular text based courses related to programming. 3. Text blog for Podcast: Do you run a podcast or want to create one ? Well don’t miss the opportunity to convert your podcast episode into a blog post. Well if you think why, here are few reasons  You can add supporting docs/images for the podcasts as a blog post where viewers can refer to your blog while listening to podcast.  Going back to SEO example, having a content for audio can help you rank on search engines which in turn can drive traffic to your podcast. Similarly you can direct your podcast traffic to grow your website too. Example: How to Repurpose a Blog Post into a Podcast Episode 4. Cheat sheets: Cheatsheets are the quick reference posts. Best suited for programming language syntax, commands, quick tips to remember some key concepts etc. If you haven’t created cheatsheet already, definitely give a try to create one.  Try to create cheatsheets in a visually appealing format. Biggest reason for that being people start to link to your cheatsheets which can help gain backlinks to your site helping gain domain authority to your posts. Examples: Markdown syntax cheatsheet PostgreSQL Vs MySQL comparison cheatsheet 5. Tutorials: Tutorial posts don’t need an introduction. In these type of posts, we pick a topic and provide a step by step guide to explain a specific topic. These are great for explaining specific topics both in depth and depth.  Depending on type of tutorial, these posts can be lengthy or short. If the posts are written in detail, it would be helpful to easily create videos out of it, as you have the script ready to be recorded as a video.  Quick tip: Try writing tutorial sites as detailed as possible and try to cover both in depth and breadth of the article. This helps in better SEO as Google loves in depth articles for page ranking. Example: Carbon language tutorial 6. How to guides: How to guides are similar to tutorials, just that they solve a very specific problem. Tutorials can be like a mini course covering various aspects of a topic. How to guides has focus on small topic. Examples: How to convert Java object to JSON string? How to read file as string in java 7. Programming solutions: If you are preparing for interviews or want to help people preparing for interviews, writing blog post to simplify and describe a specific problem/algorithm is a great way to build audience to your blog. Lot of coding platforms like Leetcode, Hackerrank, Codeforces have problems that doesn’t have good solutions. Creating solution articles to those posts is a great opportunity to gain traffic. Example: Coding Interview solutions 8. Solutions to stack overflow problems: Did you know sites like stackoverflow, quora, reddit etc are great places to get blog content ideas? When you look at a question on stackoverflow, you will see lot of answers posted by multiple people. You can take the top questions and create a blog post to summarize multiple solutions as a listicle with detailed examples.  You can check the traffic stats in stackoverflow or quora and decide to write an article out of it. In that way you can instantly know the potential traffic that are in need of a specific question. Examples: [Solved] Carbon language not working execvp llvm-ar file not found error Reference Stackoverflow post:Some one actually used this post as example in stackoverflow to explain to others Carbon language brew install llvm error 9. Comparison posts: Comparison between two or more languages/frameworks/architectures/tools are a great way to catch instant attention. For example if you make a comparison post between PostgreSQL vs MySQL databases, it has opportunity to gain audience from both PostgreSQL and MySQL users.    Comparison posts can be tricky sometimes as you are dealing with fans and non-fans of a specific tool or language or framework etc that you are trying to compare. So have a neutral tone always to avoid conflicts.     If written well, these posts have huge potential to be shared in multiple domains.     When you write comparison posts, try to add a side by side table. This helps google to index your site better to show them on featured snippets as shown in the example below.   Examples: Carbon language vs Rust comparisonPostgreSQL vs MySQL Comparison 10. Guest Interviews: Everyone likes to be featured / interviewed in news or blog posts. Guest interviews are a great way to make connections and gain visibility to your blog. You can interview people about their personal or technical achievements and write a blog post out of it. Initially when your blog is new, some reputed personalities might not give interviews to you. So start with someone in the mid successful in their careers and as the blog gets some traction reach out to more successful people and feature them in your blog. Once you do that you can ask the person you are trying to interview to share them to their audience which increases your blog traffic and authority. Example: How a Google recruiter prepared for her own interview 11. Review sites: Other type of blog posts people often search are the review posts. You can pick multiple products solving the same problem and provide your reviews. You can crowd-source your reviews by asking opinions / surveys to your existing audience and include those testimonials in your blog. Example: Google cloud review 12. Negative posts: One of the crudest ways to gain blog traffic is writing negative posts / reviews. Majority of blogs talk about good things. But less number of posts actually talk about negatives of a tool or technology or solution. When writing negative posts try focusing on providing actionable feedback while describing the cons of a particular topic. Also include data points to support your negative feedback. In that way readers of the post actually consider the post a genuine feedback instead of thinking of it as a marketing post. Example: I stopped using Visual Studio Code 13. Biography posts: Biographies are a great way to inspire and influence people. Take a biography specific to your blog niche. For example, if you are blogging about programming in java, include a biography post about James Gosling, the inventor of Java. Whenever people learn about a specific topic they would like to learn more about who developed or invented that particular framework. So give it a try. Example: Dennis Ritchie, father of C programming 14. Engineering / Architecture posts: Engineering blogs are a great example of architecture posts. When you implement a technology at scale or when you tried something different than what others are doing, writing a blog post for these topics is a great idea. Almost every top technology company has a blog dedicated for engineering. You can get inspirations from these engineering blogs for your next blog post. Examples: Twitter engineering blog Amazon architecture blog 15. Experiences: Writing about personal experiences connects you personally with your readers. Write about your experiences learning something or some of the challenges you faced when doing something. These posts are a great idea to enlighten your audience. Examples: Experiences with various ideas 16. News &amp; Trends: Latest news and writing posts related to latest trending topics is one other good idea to guage user attention. Just be aware of the competition when spending time on it as there are thousands of news blogs. In addition to these effective ideas, here are few more types of coding posts that you can write about: 17. Checklists 18. Collection of resources 19. Letters 20. Tips and facts 21. Class notes 22. Handwritten images or notes 23. Simple one page tools 24. Algorithm explanation posts 25. Standards in the industry 26. Surveys / Performance reports Additional resources: 20 Types of programming posts 15 Inspiring Blog Post Ideas for Developers Conclusion: There are tons of other variations of articles that you can write about. When you decide your next blog post, think in a long term on what is more useful for your audience. Put the user first and then work back word to decide on an idea. In addition to that, make sure you do some SEO analysis on whether users are really asking for the type of topic that you want to write about. Try free Google Ads keyword research tool and get an idea of traffic for specific keywords to include in your post and pick one of the type of posts from above list.

    "body": "2022/08/21 - In the previous post we learnt about the top 10 most loved programming languages of 2022 and which companies use them. Working with programming languages is always fun. Every language is designed for a specific purpose and things can evolve differently as technology makes progress. Quick disclaimer: Each language has its own advantages and disadvantages and everyone of us has our favourites and not so favourites. This post is purely for educational purposes and not meant to demote or promote any specific language. Stackoverflow conducted a developer survey in 2022 in various categories of technology, programming languages, professional tools, cloud providers etc. This survey is the primary source of data for this article. In this post, we will look at top 10 most hated programming languages of 2022 and what they are used for, based on 71,467 responses received from StackOverflow survey. To have a neutral tone, we will use dreaded (instead of hated) as we go through the post. Alright! let’s get started! Here is the top 10 most dreaded programming language list 1.

    "body": "2022/08/14 - The moment Google open-sourced Carbon programming language with a goal to become a successor to C++, it brought a huge attention among Rust language communities with some of the questions like  What’s the comparison between Carbon language vs Rust ? Why Carbon language when we have Rust already as potential C++ successor? Will Carbon language fully replace C++ ?Well, answering these questions may not be straight forward unless we do a detailed analysis between Rust and Carbon language. In this article, we will go through the comparison between Carbon language vs Rust and get some insights on above questions towards the end of this post. As we go through the post, we will also have a side by side comparison for Carbon to Rust for the listed properties. Please note that Carbon vs Rust Syntax level detailed comparison will be coming soon. So stay tuned! Let’s get started. Carbon language vs Rust Comparison: Here is the comparison across various properties for each of these languages. 1. Purpose and history: Rust Lang:  Rust (or Rust-lang) was originally developed by former Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare as a personal project which got sponsorship form Mozilla in 2009 and was announced in 2010. Rust 1. 0 was release on May 15, 2015.  The primary purpose / goals of Rust are to provide Performance, Reliability with high safety, concurrency.  It’s used in many production systems in various backend applications, cross-platform command-line tools, embedded systems, WebAssembly etc. Carbon Language:  Carbon language (or Carbon-lang) was announced publicly on 19 July 2022 at CPP North conference by Chandler Carruth along with his team. Carbon is still in development phase and there is no working compiler yet and only has demo interpreter which you can play around with this Carbon language tutorial.  Primary purpose of Carbon language is to have faster performance (similar to C++), Bi-directional Interoperability and migration from C++ (ranging from inheritance to templates), modern syntax.  While it is still early to predict exact applications using Carbon, it can be inferred to have applications in various backend systems, embedded systems etc. One of the main areas Carbon wants to excel is in codebases that are heavy on C++ code and would require easy migration to C++ successors. If you are new to Carbon, you can get started with video tutorials on this Carbon language youtube channel 2. Interoperability: Language Interoperability ( in short interop ) is the ability of one programming language to be able to interact with a different programming language as part of the same system. So code written in one language should be compatible with code written in another language. As new languages evolve, having interoperability is a key element which can make new language adoption easy. Comparing Carbon vs Rust interoperability with C++, Interoperability in Rust:  Rust doesn’t have native language level support for interoperability with C++. Rust supports interop with C. However C++ interop is still not in place and an ongoing work, although it has large gap to support C++. So the common pattern is to rewrite the code in Rust instead of doing an interop with C++.  However there are external libraries like cxx and autocxx which try to solve this problem out of the box for interoperability in Rust-lang. Interoperability in Carbon:  Carbon supports bidirectional interoperability with C++. So code written in Carbon can be called in C++ using subset of library wrappers and code written in C++ can be called in Carbon easily.  This is one of the primary selling points of Carbon as they want to make migration from C++ code relatively seamless3. Garbage collection: At a very high level, garbage collection is an automatic process to clean up unused variables/references from program memory especially the heap memory. As the programs execute, variables or objects that are no longer referenced in the code accumulate space on the heap. So cleaning up these resources is important for efficient memory management. Some languages (Eg: Java, python, golang ) perform garbage collection at run time using periodic background threads to deallocate space. Few other languages (Eg: Rust) achieve this by adding relevant cleanup code at compile time. Garbage collection differences between Carbon and Rust are as follows: GC in Rust:  Rust is a GC free language. It manages memory cleanup using ownership mechanism. When a variable goes out of scope and is not reachable, 2 things can happen.      Ownership of that variable can be transferred to some other variable or   The memory associated with the out of scope variable is freed up.    All of this happens at compile time by adding relevant cleanup code. So there is no real garbage collection that happens at run time in Rust. GC in Carbon language:  Carbon language does not have GC either. Just like C++, carbon-lang provides methods to manually manage memory. In C++ we need to use new and delete to allocate and deallocate the memory.  Similar to that Carbon language has heap. New and heap. Delete to allocate and deallocate memory. Although this can have some cons in terms of unwanted memory errors this is a general usage pattern for low level languages. Some of the common errors are addressed using memory safety goals of carbon-lang. 4. Safety in Carbon vs Rust: Safety of a programming language involves secure mechanisms to safeguard against software bugs and security vulnerabilities. Some common safety mechanisms include Spatial Memory safety, Temporal memory safety, Type safety, Date race safety. You can read more about them here Rust Safety:  Safety is the first citizen in Rust. Rust supports safety at compile time. To avoid Garbage collection at runtime , Rust automatically adds relevant code based on variable scopes.  This helps avoiding manual memory allocation thereby enhancing overall language safety.  Rust is memory-safe, type-safe, null-safe and thread-safe by design. If the compiler detects the code is unsafe, it throws compilation errors. Unless you specifiy unsafe keyword Rust doesn’t allow you to perform unsafe code. Safety in Carbon Language:  Carbon language has high priority to performance over Safety. It has tight goals to achieve performance similar to C++. This means some of the options like Garbage collection etc. , should be manually managed (at-least initially with incremental feature addition).  Carbon main focus is the ability to perform migration from C++ with interop. As per Carbon docs,  The only well understood mechanism of achieving safety without giving up performance is compile-time safety. The leading example of how to achieve this is Rust. So as the language evolves, compile time safety similar to Rust could be an option for Carbon. 5. Borrow checker: Borrow checker is a mechanism that validates and helps you manage ownership rules in the code.  Rust has borrow checker. Borrow checker is the key sauce of sauce. It helps Rust manage ownership at compile time.  Carbon language does not have borrow checker as it offers manual memory allocation mechanisms. 6. Package manager: Package manager is a program / tool that can automate common development workflows like creating builds, download and install libraries or dependencies required for the codebase etc. They can interact with language specific compiler to perform builds. With package managers you can publish your own packages to a central repositories, which in-turn can be packaged into other projects easily. Some of the most frequently used package managers are maven, gradle, pip, cargo etc. Package manager in Rust: Cargo is the package manager for Rust. Every executable program or library in Rust is called a Crate. The central repository for Rust packages is crates. io . With Cargo you can download dependencies, compile, distribute packages with Crates package registry. Package manager in Carbon Lang: Looking at Carbon language goals, it is projected to include package manager as part of Carbon tools and ecosystem.  Infrastructure to enable package management and other library ecosystem support: The goal is to support what the ecosystem needs, regardless of the exact form this ends up taking. Source: Carbon language goals While the exact timelines and details are not clear, keeping the current goals in mind, carbon language can include package manager as an improvement compared to C++. Alright, keeping these differences in mind, let’s try to answer the questions that we had in the beginning of this post. As a quick recap to this article, here is the quick comparison between carbon language vs Rust. Carbon language vs Rust side by side comparison: Here is a quick side by side comparison of Carbon vs Rust.

Plans to support it in future    Yes. Currently supported        Modern syntax    Yes    Yes    Why Carbon language when we have Rust already to become C++ successor ?: To address C++ evolution needs, Rust is considered a decent language to be its successor. In fact Carbon language suggests using Rust if you can in the Why not Rust section.  If you want to use Rust, and it is technically and economically viable for your project, you should use Rust. But Rust has its own advantages and disadvantages especially in terms of interoperability with C++. If the codebase is heavy on C++ , it’s difficult to migrate to Rust as it is. The code might have to be re-written in Rust. But Carbon wants to excel in this area Will Carbon language fully replace C++ ?: Since Carbon is too early in its development we cannot exactly predict this. Based on a tiny survey (https://twitter. com/thetipseason/status/1553811165280477186) of this question “Do you think Carbon language will fully replace C++ in the future?” 53. 3% voted No, 13. 3% voted Yes , while 33. 3% are neutral on this. Do you thing Carbon language will fully replace C++ in the future ? #CarbonLang #cplusplus #programming #languages #code &mdash; TipSeason (@thetipseason) July 31, 2022Things can change a lot while the language is still growing. We will cover this closely as things evolve, so make sure to subscribe to our Carbon language newsletter. What do you think the future of Carbon is ? Drop your thoughts in the comments.

    "body": "2022/08/09 - Google introduced Carbon language as the next generation programming language with a goal to replace C++ as a successor. It’s an open source project still in experimental phase. Originally demonstrated by Chandler Carruth in CppNorth conference, Carbon language looks like a great alternative to C++. Carbon language release date is 19 July 2022 In this tutorial we will learn about various aspects of Carbon language and jump into carbon language basic syntax along with examples code that you can use to try the language after reading through the end of this documentation. Let’s dive in. Introduction to Carbon Language: Carbon language can replace C++ as things evolve. C++ is already a great language to work with. It can give high performance and widely used in many production systems. It can run with multiple platforms, hardware architecture and many operating systems. However some of the problems with C++ are  Accumulated technical debt (eg: Integer promotion rules) across various functionalities. Backward compatibility with C makes it even more hard to fix tech debt and make code changes hard to implement.  Evolution process to add new functionalities to C++ is very difficult as it needs to adhere to ISO process overhead, preventing from experimentation etc. So C++ is falling short of some of it’s goals like Performance critical software; Software and language evolution; Code that is easy to understand and write; Fast and scalable development and so on. Since solving these problems with C++ is really hard, after a deep research and evaluation across multiple languages by Google engineers, Carbon programming language is introduced. So it is like a successor to C++ similar to  C -&gt; C++ JavaScript -&gt; TypeScript Objective-C -&gt; Swift Java -&gt; Kotlin C++ -&gt; Carbon Languagewhere the left part of arrow is the original language and right part is the replacing language. Some of the key aspects of successor languages include - Building on top of existing ecosystem, Bi-directional interoperability, Optimize learning curve , Modern tooling systems like package manager etc. Carbon language is not inherited from legacy C or C++. It’s built from scratch with modern language fundamentals such as Generics, Modular code, Consistent, Simple syntax. Key features of Carbon language:  Fast performance matching C++ using LLVM (low level virtual machine), having low level access to bits and addresses.  Bi-directional Interoperability indicates that you can call C++ language code from Carbon language and Carbon language code from C++.  Migration Provides support to migrate code from C++.  Modern and evolving features like fast and scalable builds that can work with existing C++ builds, easier to learn.  Built with Open Source with clear goals and priorities having batteries included approach such as compilers, libraries, documentation, package manager etc. Carbon language VS Rust comparison: As part of the Carbon language evolution, lot of factors are considered. Some of them include taking a look at garbage collected languages (like Java), more modern language such as Rust , swift , Kotlin and so on. Rust is thoroughly evaluated as a replacement to C++. Infact Carbon language insists to use Rust and ignore Carbon if possible as Rust is technically and economically more viable language. However for organizations that are already using C++ , it’s very difficult to migrate to Rust. Software written in Rust has properties and modules that non of the languages like C++ or Carbon has. Adapting to Rust for large C++ codebases is almost not practical given that there is no inter-operability. We will talk in depth about this in a separate article soon. If you are still curious, you can learn more about it here on why Rust is not a replacement for C++. Here is a detailed comparison between Carbon language vs Rust. Rust vs Carbon comparison Now that we know what Carbon language is and why we need to use it, let’s dive into the actual setup/installation, syntax, examples. Alright! Let’s jump into carbon language. How to setup and install Carbon language:: Getting started with Carbon language involves installation of  Homebrew: is a package installation tool. If you don’t have homebrew installed you can follow these instructions . In MacOs you can install homebrew using /bin/bash -c  $(curl -fsSL https://raw. githubusercontent. com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install. sh)  Bazel : Bazel is an open-source build and test tool which can support multiple languages, platforms.  LLVM: LLVM is a low level virtual machine that Carbon language uses to run. You may not need to have full knowledge of LLVM to follow this tutorial.  Carbon Explorer: Carbon explorer is like an implementation tool to Carbon language. To run all the programs of Carbon lang, we will use carbon explorer. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use MacOS to install. However instructions for other operating systems like linux or windows can be similar. If you have any questions on installation or if carbon language is not working for any reason, you can drop a comment on this post. Will try to solve the issue. To install carbon lang, run these commands in your terminal. Step 1: Install Bazel: To install Bazel you can run 1$ brew install bazeliskThis should automatically install and setup Bazel that is ready to use. If you have any errors related to permissions, the error message from Bazel will have useful command to run. Try to run that command using sudo Step 2: Install LLVM: LLVM is the core virtual machine on which carbon language is run on. To install it 12$ brew install llvm$ export PATH= $(brew --prefix llvm)/bin:${PATH} One thing to note is MacOS has a default llvm . So using brew install llvm may give message like llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked . . . . To solve this problem go to Carbon language Installation errors troubleshooting section at the end of this article to solve this problem. Step 3: Setup Carbon language code: This step is to download carbon lang code which also has some examples. 12$ git clone https://github. com/carbon-language/carbon-lang$ cd carbon-langStep 4: Hello world with Carbon language: Now that we have setup Carbon language, let’s do a quick run for Hello world. To do that we will use Carbon explorer to run. To run your first code in Carbon, make sure you are in the carbon-lang directory that you cloned from git and then run below command. 1$ bazel run //explorer -- . /explorer/testdata/print/format_only. carbonWhat this line is doing is to invoke Bazel build tool to trigger explorer code that in turns runs the actual code present in the . /explorer/testdata/print/format_only. carbon file. Once you run this you should see a Hello world in Carbon output like this 12345678910tipseason$ bazel run //explorer -- . /explorer/testdata/print/format_only. carbonINFO: Invocation ID: aa36a266-cb55-4433-9bed-907e393c0605WARNING: . . . . . . . INFO: Build completed successfully, 390 total actions. . Hello world!result: 0As you can see “Hello World!” is printed and return type of main is int32 resulting to 0. The code that is behind this hello world program is File path: . /explorer/testdata/print/format_only. carbon 1234567package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -&gt; i32 { var s: auto =  Hello world! ; Print(s); return 0;}For windows, Carbon language is not yet natively supported. However you can install wsl which is like installing Linux on top of windows. You can do that using wsl --install and then perform above steps. The file extension for Carbon language code is . carbon . So if you write new carbon language file you need to have a file which ends with extension of . carbon. Example: demo. carbon . Now that we have carbon language setup, let’s look at the some of the basic syntax that can be used in day to day basis for Carbon language. Video tutorial: If you prefer to watch video version of this tutorial including live demos + walkthrough installation and working examples, you can follow this youtube video too. Let’s jump into Carbon language basic syntax. Carbon Language Basic Syntax with examples:: Carbon language is still in experimental phases. While most of the design choices are made already, some of the syntax and usage might change as things evolve. So keep that in mind while working with Carbon-lang. One great thing about Carbon is that the syntax should be C/C++ developer friendly and easy to understand. For the best use of this tutorial, to follow along with each of these examples, You can run the below examples using Carbon language explorer that you installed in the previous step. If you are running in your own machine, you can create new files each time you run a program or modify . /explorer/testdata/print/format_only. carbon file to check the examples. Each time you modify the code , run bazel run //explorer -- . /explorer/testdata/print/format_only. carbon to see the output. Note: format_only. carbon is just a sample file. Change it to whichever filename you created. Alternatively, you can also use Carbon online explorer IDE to run through the below examples. Just copy paste below examples in the online IDE and you can see live results. Link for online carbon explorer IDE is at Carbon Godbolt or Carbon online explorer Let’s get started on how to use carbon language. Declarations in carbon lang::  Methods/Functions are declared using fn keyword.  Variables are declared using var keyword.  Variable names should end with : followed by space eg: var x: Constants can be declared using let keyword.  Packages are declared using package keyword.  Comments in Carbon language can be declared using two slashes // auto can be used to automatically infer the variable type. It can be used in combination of let or var or as function return types. Example/ Demo code: 12345678910111213package ExplorerTest api;//fn is function declaration//return type is i32 i. e. int. fn Main() -&gt; i32 { //I am a comment.  var s: auto =  Hello world! ; // Auto Variable  let x: i32 = 20; // Constant var y: i32 = 3; // Integer variable  Print(s); // Print  return 0; //Return value }Functions/Methods in Carbon: Functions can be declared using fn keyword. The syntax is fn MethodName(var param: type . . . ) -&gt; return type . For void or empty return types , you can ignore the part after -&gt; Example: 1234567891011121314151617package ExplorerTest api;//Integer return type fn Sum(var a: i32, var b: i32) -&gt; i32 {  return a + b;}//Empty or void return type. fn PrintCount(var count: i32) {  Print( The count is {0} , count);}fn Main() -&gt; i32 {  Print( Sum is {0} , Sum(4, 6));  PrintCount(10);  return 0;}Numeric Variables in carbon lang:: Variables in carbon language can be  bool for boolean true or false i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, i256 for integer types.  u8, u16, u32, u128, u256 for unsigned integer types.  f16, f32, f64, and f128 for float types.  _ can be used for digit separators. Eg: 1_000_000 is still an integer if declared without quotes. Example: 12345678package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -&gt; i32 { var a: i32 = 1; var b: i32 = 2; Print(a + b); return 0;}Strings in carbon language:: Strings can be declared using  String for byte sequence StringView as a read only reference for utf-8 byte sequence. Strings literals can be declared in two ways.  Single Line: Use double quotation mark( ) for single line.  Multi line string: For multi line string declaration use (   )Example: 12345678910package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -&gt; i32 { var singleLine: String =  Hello world! ; var multiLine: String =    hello line 1      TipSeason demo line 2      TipSeason demo line 3         ; //End of multi block return 0;}Tuples in carbon lang:: Tuples represent values with multiple coordinates. They can be declared using parenthesis ( ) **Example / Sample code ** 12345678package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -&gt; i32 { var x: auto = (0, 1); Print( {0} , x[1]); return x[0];}Here (x,y,z) is a tuple with multiple coordinates. They can be accessed using the index. Pointers in Carbon lang:: There are no null pointers in Carbon. To represent a pointer that may not refer to a valid object, use the type Optional(T*) where T is the type. * represents value. &amp; represents address. **Example: ** 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -&gt; i32 { var x: i32 = 5; // changes x to 10 x = 10; Print( --- ); Print( x = {0} , x); var y: i32* = &amp;x; // changes x to 7 *y = 7; Print( --- ); Print( x = {0} , x); Print( y = {0} , *y); var z: i32* = &amp;*y; // changes x to 0 *z = 0; Print( --- ); Print( x = {0} , x); Print( y = {0} , *y); Print( z = {0} , *z); var w: i32 = *y; return w;}Arrays in Carbon:: Arrays are declared using array type and the size. Syntax is [type; size]Eg: var xarray: [i32; 4] = (1,2,3,4); Example 12345678910package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -&gt; i32 { var xarray: [i32; 4] = (0, 1, 5, 6); // Integer array  var index: i32 = 1; xarray[index] = 0; Print( {0} , xarray[0]); Print( {1} , xarray[0]); return xarray[0] + xarray[1];}Conditional control flow with carbon: Combination of if , else can be used to control the conditional flow in Carbon. **if-else: ** 12345if(condition) { //doSomething} else { //doSomething}if-else-if 12345678if(condition) { //doSomething} else if (condition) { //doSomething} else { //doSomething} Example: 123456789101112package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -&gt; i32 { var x: i32 = 5; if(x == 5) {  Print( {0} to word is FIVE , x); } else {  Print( {0} is not known  , x); } return 0;}Loops in Carbon language: Standards looping statements are supported. While loop: While loop can be declared using while(condition){ } Example: 12345678910package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -&gt; i32 { var x: auto = 5; while (not (x == 0)) {  x = x - 1;  Print( {0}  , x); } return x;}For Loop: For loop can be declared using for (loop conditions) { } . At the time of writing this article didn’t get full working example. But here is the proposed syntax. 1234567891011package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -&gt; i32 { var names: [String; 4] = ( a ,  b ); for (var name: String in names) {  Console. Print(name); } return x;}Match multiple conditions similar to Switch: Carbon has match keyword which is similar to switch in C/C++. Syntax for match is 12345678match(condition) { case (condition) =&gt; {  //doSomething; } default =&gt; {  //doSomething; }}Example: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526package ExplorerTest api;fn Matcher(var num: i32) -&gt; i32 { var number: auto = 10; match (number) {  case 5 =&gt; {   Print( Got 5 );   return number;  }  case 10 =&gt; {   Print( Got 10 );   return number;  }  default =&gt; {   Print( Default );   return number;  } }}fn Main() -&gt; i32 {  Matcher(5);  Matcher(10);  Matcher(2);  return 0;}Classes in Carbon Lang:: Class in carbon language can be declared using class keyword. Class can have members and methods. Here is an example class implementation. 1234567891011121314151617package ExplorerTest api;class Sum { var a: i32; fn Add[me: Self](var num: i32) -&gt; i32 {   var total: i32 = me. a + num;   return total; }}fn Main() -&gt; i32 { var p1: Sum = {. a = 5}; var total: i32 = p1. Add(5); Print( Total sum {0}  , total); return 0;}Structs in Google carbon language:: Structural types help you identify members using the name instead of their index/position. They are declared within curly braces var name: auto = {. name1 = value1, . name2 = value2, . . . } and can be accessed using name. name1 etc. Example: 123456789package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -&gt; i32 { var point: auto = {. x_axis = 0, . y_axis = 1}; point = {. x_axis = 5, . y_axis = -5}; var result: i32 = point. x_axis * point. x_axis + point. y_axis * point. y_axis; Print( Result : {0} , result); return 0;}Generics in Carbon programming language:: Generics can be seen in many modern languages. They define a way to induce compile time type checks and helps define cleaner type variables. They can be declared using T paramter types are shown below. Example: 1234567891011package ExplorerTest api;fn GenericExample[T:! Type](x: T) -&gt; T { return x;}fn Main() -&gt; i32 { Print( Integer generic type {0} , GenericExample(0)); Print(GenericExample( This is a string generic )); return 0;}Memory safety in Carbon language:: Carbon language has a heavy focus on memory management especially when it comes to memory safety. At a very high level carbon language plans to achieve memory safety using  Spatial Memory safety Temporal memory safetyHere is a detailed tutorial on how memory safety is achieved in carbon along with goals and basics. Check Carbon language memory safety for secure memory management Carbon language Installation errors troubleshooting : Carbon llvm-ar error fix: 1234567891011llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,because macOS already provides this software and installing another version inparallel can cause all kinds of trouble. If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run: echo 'export PATH= /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH ' &gt;&gt; /Users/pramodnanduri/. bash_profileFor compilers to find llvm you may need to set: export LDFLAGS= -L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib  export CPPFLAGS= -I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include To solve this problem configure your ~/. bash_profile file to have following variables 1234export PATH= /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH export LDFLAGS= -L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib export CPPFLAGS= -I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include export CC=$(which clang)Once you save it make sure to runsource ~/. bash_profile If you have other errors , drop a comment below .

    "body": "2022/08/02 - Google introduced Carbon programming language with a modern language syntax to become a successor to C++. One of the challenges many beginner developers are facing is to run basic examples since the language is in a very early stage without even having a compiler. So here is a working example to print fibonacci series using Carbon language. How to print fibonacci series in carbon lang: To recollect Fibonacci series, here the following sequence that we want to print. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 . . . . Currently, there is no support &lt; symbol yet in Carbon language. Also for loop is not yet supported in carbon language. So we will use different approach. To print fibonacci series in carbon, we will use combination of recursion + iteration to print fibonacci sequence. Here are 2 steps we follow.  Print nth fibonacci number in Carbon programming language Print fibonacci sequence using While loop in carbonlangLet’s dive in Step 1: Print nth fibonacci number in Carbon language: We use a recursive code to calculate nth fibonacci number using the follow recursive formula. 12fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); if n &lt;= 1 we can just print n. Let’s write code in carbon language. 1234567891011121314fn Square(x: i32) -&gt; i32 { return x * x;}fn fib(n: i32) -&gt; i32 {  if(n == 0) {    return 0;  }  if(n == 1) {    return 1;  }  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);}Step 2: Print fibonacci sequence using While loop in carbonlang: The next step is the call fib(n) for n times. This can be achieved using while loop. Observe fib(i) inside Print method. 12345678fn fibSeries(count: i32) {  var i: i32 = count;  while(not (i == 0)) {    Print( {0} , fib(i));    i = i - 1;  }}Print fibonacci sequence in carbonlang: Connecting two pieces together, we can have 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435package sample api;fn Square(x: i32) -&gt; i32 { return x * x;}fn fib(n: i32) -&gt; i32 {  if(n == 0) {    return 0;  }  if(n == 1) {    return 1;  }  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);}fn fibonacciSeries(count: i32) {  var i: i32 = count;  while(not (i == 0)) {    Print( {0} , fib(i));    i = i - 1;  }}fn Main() -&gt; i32 {  var n: i32 = 6;  Print( Input n: {0} , n);  Print( nth fibonacci number result: {0} , fib(n));  Print( ----------- , n);   Print( Fibonacci series for n = {0} , n);  fibonacciSeries(10);  return 0;}The output for this would be 1234567891011121314Input n: 6nth fibonacci number result: 8-----------Fibonacci series for n = 655342113853211You can try this by yourself using carbon language compiler explorer online:Compiler explorer Additional Reading in Carbon language: Carbon language memory safety for secure memory management:Carbon language memory management This is a part of carbon language series for beginners.

    "body": "2022/08/01 - Carbon language memory safety for secure memory managementGoogle open sourced Carbon language with a goal become a successor of C++. In the previous post, we learnt about what carbon language is along with syntax and working examples. In case you missed it , here is the link for carbon language tutorial One of the primary goals of Google carbon programming language is the memory safety as part of its memory management. Having a safer fundementals with incremental goals towards achieving robust memory safety is the key. In this tutorial we will learn about what is memory safety and how google carbon language provides memory safety as part of the memory management. What is memory safety ?: Memory safety is the property of programming languages to provide a secure mechanism to safeguard against software bugs and security vulnerabilities related to memory management. Memory safety bugs are very critical as they compromise the security of the application. Some of the common memory safety bugs involve  Buffer Overflows: When data is written to a buffer, in certain vulnerable situations, the data might be written to adjacent memory boundaries and overrides the existing data in those locations. This is a serious security concern.  Dangling pointers: Dangling pointers are the pointers that have invalid references to deleted/deallocated objects. When designing a programming language and writing applications, dealing with memory safety is important. Some of the programming languages likeJava, Rust, C#, Swift, Pythin , JavaScript provide memory safety as part of the language design. Run-time error detection is a common technique(for example in Java) to perform array bounds and pointer dereferences that help in memory safety. Languages like C, C++ does not provide memory safety as they allow arbitrary pointer arithmetic. Carbon language has principles and design goals to achieve memory safety. How carbon language achieves memory safety: Carbon language has bunch of safety design principles to address “safety”. As part of that, there are different ways memory safety is achieved in carbonlang. Let’s look at each of them. 1. Spatial Memory safety: Spatial memory safety is similar to buffer overflows. It’s a way to protect access to address locations that are out of bounds for the source. This memory safety includes  Array boundary checks Dereference invalid pointers for uninitialized pointers, handling NULL in C++. 2. Temporal memory safety: Temporal memory safety involves avoiding access to addresses once they are deallocated. So if the address is deallocated, ideally it should be restricted to protect against these references. Checks that involve temporal memory safety in carbon are  use-after-free for heap use-after-return for stack addresses. As part of address checks, there are two other design principles for carbon language memory management. 3. Type safety: If a valid memory location is accessed with an invalid type, it will be restricted. “Type Confusion” is what Carbon names it. 4. Date race safety: When multiple threads access same memory location involving reads and writes, that memory location needs to be properly protected against race conditions. Having a language level support for race conditions can be a great advantage when dealing with synchronization problems for multithreading. So these are some of the design principles and goals that carbon language plan to have as part of memory management. Memory safety is a critical part for programming languages but they are also tricky areas to handle. Let’s look at how Carbon plan to achieve it. Memory safety roadmap: One of the key goals of Carbon language is to support interoperability (the ability to call C++ code from carbon language and viceversa). Dealing with the combination of Memory safety + interoperability can be very challenging as C++ is not a memory safe language. However being a successor language to C++ , carbon language is committed to memory safety in a phased approach. Based on the current status of carbon language, here is the roadmap for memory management. The primary priority for handling memory safety in Carbon is to address  Having a clean tracking for un-intialized states. Variable initialization enforcement and having a systematic solution to initialization bugs whereever possible Provide dynamic boundary checks to debug and harden builds Providing debug mode for builds which provide granular information for address references so that there errors can be detected at build time itself. This debug should also be available even when using Address Sanitizer.      Address Sanitizer is a memory error detector for C/C++. It can find Dangling pointer references, Heap buffer overflow, Global buffer overflow, Use after scope, memory leaks and many more in a faster way.    Once the above goals are achieved then future goals like ‘Safe Carbon Subset’ will be addressed even though the intial 0. 1 design doesn’t handle this, there are definitely plans to address memory management with fundemental concepts around ‘safety’ Conclusion:: As we know , Carbon language is still in development phase, these goals might change rapidly as things evolve. Having a clear roadmap on how these problems needs to be addressed when building a new language is very important and Carbon looks like it’s in a right direction to achieve these goals. Hope this tutorial helps you to understand some of the basic concepts of Carbon language memory management using memory safety and how Carbon plans to address this them at language level support.

In addition you should see the warning message like: 1234567891011121314151617181920tipseason$ brew install llvm==&gt; Downloading https://ghcr. io/v2/homebrew/core/llvm/manifests/14. 0. 6_1Already downloaded: /Users/tipseason/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/cbaac22cb6f6e244c64563571c7d26a3e3ea4b1471e2bdc333593090506fd348--llvm-14. 0. 6_1. bottle_manifest. json==&gt; Downloading https://ghcr. io/v2/homebrew/core/llvm/blobs/sha256:c0a14a92f8b6a1476ed853ad53baa225e561100354f63ed7ee88e664f187d117Already downloaded: /Users/tipseason/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/6d094cf421785eec188be3e2f10f53012e620d4b19c4ad6d0e9a5992131ac662--llvm--14. 0. 6_1. monterey. bottle. tar. gz==&gt; Pouring llvm--14. 0. 6_1. monterey. bottle. tar. gz==&gt; CaveatsTo use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS: LDFLAGS= -L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,because macOS already provides this software and installing another version inparallel can cause all kinds of trouble. If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run: echo 'export PATH= /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH ' &gt;&gt; /Users/tipseason/. bash_profileFor compilers to find llvm you may need to set: export LDFLAGS= -L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib  export CPPFLAGS= -I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include As you can see in the above warning, llvm installed by homebrew doesn’t link the paths properly due to conflict with MacOS. So when we run bazel command, it expects the llvm to be present in /usr/bin/llvm-ar path. That is the reason in the error message you should see the error like execvp(/usr/bin/llvm-ar, . . . ) : No such file or directory . The path is not being resolved properly by bazel. To fix this issue,:  Open ~/. bash_profile file. In that enter the following commands and save the file.   1234export PATH= /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH export LDFLAGS= -L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib export CPPFLAGS= -I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include export CC=$(which clang)    Once you save the file, run below command to compile above changes.   1source ~/. bash_profile   $CC is the main variable that fixes this issue. Now try to rerun the bazel file and you should not see the error ideally. Try it in multiple tabs or wait for sometime and retry. This should fix the issue.

    "title": "Connecting dbt mysql with PlanetScale database (Vitess) - A case study",
    "body": "2022/07/23 - When I first started playing around with dbt (data build tool), being a traditional MySQL developer, the first thing that came to my mind is Can we connect dbt with mysql ? After some research on getdbt site, I found that there is a dbt-mysql adapter which can connect dbt with mysql. But then as I digged deeper to understand dbt in a real world scenario, the immediate question that popped up is what if I have to do the data processing at scale using MySQL ? MySQL is scalable however it’s still single master node. Well that’s when Vitess came to a rescue. Since we are in cloud era and that I don’t want to manage Vitess on my own, went ahead and saw who provides Vitess as a managed service and thats when PlanetScale came into picture and is a perfect fit for our use case. What if we combine the power of dbt data transformations with mysql compatible Vitess at scale? Thats exactly what this case study is all about. In this post, we will connect dbt with Vitess using dbt-mysql adapter on PlanetScale Vitess database Cloud. For beginners, Vitess is a MySQL compatible database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. Since MySQL works with single master, Vitess helps you partition your data into multiple partitions with a unique key ( called as sharding key). It’s a proven technology at scale originally developed at Youtube. PlanetScale is a managed MySQL compatible serverless database platform. They provide database as a service with Vitess as a backend. So there we go. We have a perfect combination of  dbt ( data build tool) MySQL with dbt-mysql Managed Vitess hosted on PlanetScaleLet’s jump into connecting each of them. The flow goes like this.  Vitess is a “MySQL compatible” database. MySQL compatible database indicates that it can support MySQL syntax for all the query needs even though the underlying technology of how data is stored is different from how MySQL natively stores the data.  To connect dbt with Vitess, we will use dbt-mysql adapter which is a plugin to connect dbt with mysql or mariadb.  dbt-mysql adapter is not supported by dbt cloud (which is a dbt cloud based online ide). So for this tutorial, we will use dbt cli for working with dbt. dbt cli is a client based tool which can be used to manage the entire dbt workflows.  PlanetScale is a fully managed Vitess based service (The MySQL-compatible serverless database platform) . Let’s dive into the actual workflows. Step 1: Create PlanetScale database: First thing we will do is to signup an account with PlanetScale. This is a straight forward step like any other account signup. Here is the planetscale signup link You can follow this 35 seconds video to setup PlanetScale vitess account. Once you create an account using above steps, you can configure a pscale planetscale client (which is a shell based tool) to connect to your db. To do that, for MacOS you use below steps. For other operating systems you can follow this guide 123456789101112131415#Install Planetscale Client i. e. pscale brew install planetscale/tap/pscale#Install MySQL client that pscale can connect. brew install mysql-client#Login to planetscale account for clipscale auth login#Create database named `demo`pscale database create demo#Connect to demo database. pscale connect demoYou can access PlanetScale demo database using pscale shell using 1pscale shell demo This is just like a mysql shell. Step 2: Setup dbt client with dbt-mysql adapter: We will connect dbt-mysql adapter for using dbt client. Setting up dbt cli depends on the type of machine that you use. For the purpose of this tutorial , we will use pip to setup dbt cli with dbt-mysql adapter. If you have pip installed already you can skip this step. Step 2. 1: Setup pip:: pip (package installer for Python) is a simple package management system written in python that can be used install and manage software packages/libraries written in Python. If you don’t have pip installed already you can use run below commands in your terminal. 12curl https://bootstrap. pypa. io/get-pip. py -o get-pip. pypython3 get-pip. pyDepending on the operating system this process might be a bit different and can be installed using these pip instructions  If you are using python3 , this might be more like pip3. Step 2. 2: Setup dbt mysql adapter: Once you have pip installed , you can install dbt-mysql using the below command in your terminal. 12pip install dbt-mysqlTo verify if dbt installed fine, you can use 1dbt --versionwhich should give results similar to this 1234567891011tipseason$ dbt --versioninstalled version: 1. 0. 8  latest version: 1. 1. 1Your version of dbt is out of date! You can find instructions for upgrading here:https://docs. getdbt. com/docs/installationPlugins: - mysql5: 1. 0. 0 - No PYPI version available - mariadb: 1. 0. 0 - No PYPI version available - mysql: 1. 0. 0 - Up to date!Once you have dbt-cli installed, you can create a sample dbt project using this. 1dbt init demoprojectNow that we have dbt project ready along with planetscale database , let’s connect the two pieces. Step 3: Connect dbt-mysql with planetscale database: Inorder to connect dbt with mysql adapter, we need to modify profiles. yml file which serves as the configuration file to database connections. For mac users the location of this file is in the home folder under . dbt subfolder. In this if you don’t have a profiles. yml file, you can create one using vi ~/. dbt/profiles. yml This file should have the following configuration information. 123456789101112131415161718192021demoproject: target: dev outputs:  dev:   type: mysql5   server: [planetscale_servername]   port: 3306 # optional   database: [demo] # optional, should be same as schema   schema: [planetscale_schema]   username: [planetscale_username]   password: [planetscale_password]   driver: MySQL ODBC 8. 0 ANSI Driver  prod:   type: mysql5   server: [server/host]   port: [port] # optional   database: [schema] # optional, should be same as schema   schema: [schema]   username: [username]   password: [password]   driver: MySQL ODBC 8. 0 ANSI Driver                                                                                          Make sure you input the data without square brackets (no [ or ]). That’s it. We have all the required configurations ready. Perform sample queries with dbt-mysql and pscale:: In Step 2. 2, we created demoproject for dbt. dbt comes with sample models(my_first_dbt_model, my_second_dbt_model, my_third_dbt_model) when we initiate a project. So let’s go ahead and run our models from dbt. In terminal, 1dbt runThis will create 3 tables in planetscale vitess database. You can check it in your pscale shell using. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627tipseason$ cd demoproject tipseason$ dbt runtipseason$ pscale shell demodemo/main&gt; show tables;+---------------------+| Tables_in_demo   |+---------------------+| my_first_dbt_model || my_second_dbt_model || my_third_dbt_model |+---------------------+demo/main&gt; select * from my_first_dbt_model;+------+| id  |+------+|  1 || NULL |+------+demo/main&gt; select * from my_second_dbt_model;+------+| id  |+------+|  1 |+------+demo/main&gt; As you can see the three models are properly being populated using PlanetScale Vitess MySQL database with dbt-mysql adapter. Some Caveats:: Note that dbt-mysql is still in a testing phase and its only a community supported project. So if you plan to use this in production make sure you evaluate in more detail.

    "body": "2022/07/08 - Before jumping into the top 10 list, here is a quick quiz for you! Can you guess how many computer programming languages exist in this world? Try to guess a number without googling and look for the answer in the bottom of this post once your read the top 10 list :-) While the guess work is going on, out of all programming languages, 50 are the most used ones. Many of us stick with couple of main languages, there are indeed favorite ones for each of us and StackOverflow did a survey to understand most loved programming, scripting and markup languages. Let’s look at the top 10 most loved programming languages of 2022 and which companies are using them based on 71,547 developers report. Since each language works differently, here are two quick tips for beginners to understand some key terms What is a statically-typed language ?: A statically-typed language is a language (such as Java, C, or C++) where the variable types are known at compile time. So example : String a = “b” . Here we define String as a variable type at compile time itself. What is a dynamically typed language ?: In dynamically typed language (Eg: Javascript, Python), variable types are interpreted at runtime. Eg: a = “b” . Here type of variable a is determined at runtime. In this post, we will go through top 10 most loved programming languages of 2022.

Alright here is the answer for our quiz for how many programming languages exist in this world ?: Well as expected the answer is a variable. There are 3 most referred sources for the actual count.  Wikipedia : As per wikipedia there are about 700 of the notable notable programming languages, in current or historical use.      This is an index to notable programming languages, in current or historical use. Dialects of BASIC, esoteric programming languages, and markup languages are not included. A programming language does not need to be imperative or Turing-complete, but must be executable and so does not include markups such as HTML or XML, but does include domain specific languages such as SQL and its dialects.       PLDB Which tracks programming languages, currently has 3907 languages indexed in its database.   HOPL Stands for History of Programming Languages claims to have 8945 programming languages. In our rough guess at TipSeason, there could be more than 20,000 programming languages including different variations of programming, markdown, sql etc. If you have any other better suggestions or sources , drop a comment below.

    "body": "2022/07/08 - dbt (data build tool) has become one of the most used developmental frameworks for Data transformation. However most people don’t actually get What, Why and How part of dbt. In this guide we will go through basics of dbt focusing primarily on What is dbt! and where does it fit with a real world project example. We will slowly evolve from ETL to ELT process and finally understand the exact use case of dbt. Make sure you read through end of this article to learn a lot of Data Analytics and Data Analysis topics in real world. What is dbt ?: Let’s say you have a huge amount of raw data. For beginners, raw data can be any kind of data collected from different sources and it can contain various information like urls, payment details, order information and so on. As you can imagine, this data can contain uncleaned rows such as null values, duplicates and what not right. Now, with this raw data, you want to do some data analysis for your reports or may be feed into some machine learning model and so on right!. So dbt is a development framework that helps you transform this raw data into meaningful data objects such as database tables, views etc , using simple SELECT queries. Now once you have these data objects ready, you can use those to create your own metrics, ML models or any other data analytics. To do that, with dbt you can develop, test, document and deploy the entire data transformation changes. Maybe you still didn’t get it fully Right! Let’s take a real world example. dbt Real world example: Imagine you are running an e-commerce website something like Amazon or Shopify or any other online store. Now, things were pretty good until, one day, you suddenly started receiving a lot of complaints from your customers saying,Hey! we are not getting orders delivered in time. Well, that’s a serious problem!!To understand what’s going on, you want to dig into the root cause of why these orders are not getting delivered in time. So you want to build a simple metric like  How many orders are not getting delivered within the estimated time and what is the reason for the delay? So basically we are trying to build a report containing fields like order_id, tracking_id and reason_for_delay. Well that seems to be pretty easy right! But let’s take a look at how this can get complicated. ETL Data Pipeline: To solve this problem at scale, Let’s first try to understand what ETL is! ETL Data Extraction: In our example, first thing you might be doing is to somehow extract this information into a common place. For simplicity, assume that you got that data into two tables i. e. order table (data source1) and tracking table. Since customers can place orders on our website, we can have some of the information like order_number, order_date, tracking_number in our own database tables. Now for the actual delivery of these orders, let’s say we are relying on a third party provider (like fedex or ups) to deliver orders to the customers, which is a very common use case in the real world right. In this case, the order tracking information like delivery_status , delivery_time, reason_for_delay might be present in a different data source on the third party provider right!And one more complication could be that they can provide the data in different formats like JSON, CSV, Database, Queues and so on. So as you can see that data can be scattered in multiple places and if we have to build our metric, we need to join this data from various sources and build our data models. In this case we have tracking_id as a common field across the sources. So the first thing we need to do is to somehow extract this information into a common place. For simplicity, let’s assume that we parsed and extracted that data into two tables i. e. order table (data source1) and tracking table ( data source 2).  ETL Data transformation: Now since the data can be from different sources and things are not in our control, we need to clean the data and validate that data! So you perform various operations like Data cleansing, validation, manipulation, apply different business logic using some intermediate tables (sometimes called as staging tables) and finally come up with a single table joining the data. ETL Data Loading: Since this data can be huge, you precompute this data with only required information and make this available to users by loading into data warehouse. Since this is like a shortlisted data, it becomes easier to build metric reports , ml models from this. This step is the load part of ETL. In data world, they call this process as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) . Where the 1st part is called data extraction, 2nd part is data transformation and third part is the data loading. Wait, I still don’t see dbt in this! dbt (data Build tool) Helps in Data transformation: To understand that, let’s zoom into what happens behind the scenes into Transform part. To make your raw data into something meaningful, you transform your data by applying various operations such as data cleaning, data validation and so on. Some quick examples can include removing duplicates, checking for null values, checking for primary keys, foreign keys and custom business rules like currency conversion and so on. In order to apply these rules, you  Query the raw data with different SELECT queries Apply different data rules Select only required data Store them into separate tables for final data that you want to use daily. Since you need to generate this data every day , you build data pipelines , periodic jobs and finally store this computed data into your data warehouse for further use. From a development standpoint this requires a lot of effort to build these data pipelines. It includes developing, testing, documenting and deploying these changes. What if you need to add a new metric to my data pipeline?How can you actually maintain this pipeline without breaking anything? This is where Data Engineers come into picture. They help building these data pipelines to perform data analysis. But doesn’t this whole process look complicated? Transforming data into something useful itself looks like a very tedious process. What if this whole process of data transformation can be simplified ? What if we have a toolkit that can do all these data transformation tasks with simple configurations and SELECT queries ? Well, That’s exactly where dbt comes into picture. With dbt you can streamline this whole data transformation process with simple configurations and SELECT queries. It can even help you develop, test, document, deploy these data transformation logics with a modular approach. Again dbt is only a data transformation tool. It doesn’t handle data extraction or loading. Let’s dig into how things change with dbt Moving from ETL to ELT using dbt transformationsWith dbt the workflow becomes more like an ELT instead of ETL. Now let’s see what ELT is. In ETL , we saw that data is first extracted, transformed, loaded into warehouse. But with ELT, this workflow changes a bit. The E part remains the same.  We Extract the data from various sources Now this raw data is directly loaded into data warehouse without doing any transformation. (The key difference is in ETL data is processed and then loaded into warehouse. But in ELT data raw data is directly loaded into data warehouse without processing) Once we have raw data loaded, thats when dbt kicks in.  dbt connects with your data warehouse directly and can interact with all data reads and writes. If you want to perform some data analysis for example building a metric , all we need to do is write simple SELECT queries on the raw data table. Once you write your SELECT query and run it, dbt automatically takes care of fetching the data, applying all different validations, logics and writes the data back into your warehouse. Real advantages of dbt: You might be thinking what is the real advantage here right. Well there is a lot. If you compare your old data flow with dbt based flow,  You are interacting with raw data directly and only worry about writing SELECT queries.  Complexity of developing , testing, documenting these SELECT queries are clearly modularized into dbt modules which we will study as part of this course.  Deploying and adding new data is directly embedded into data analysis workflow. So if you want to build a new metric, you just have to change add a new SELECT query in dbt and the rest is taken care. Now that you have some background, you can read more about dbt at getdbt So using dbt, Data Engineers and Data Analysts can be combined into one single role called as Analytics Engineers. Data Analytics + Data Engineers = Analytics Engineers So your analytics engineers can act as software engineers as they can directly interact and modify data pipelines for faster data analysis.

Additional tips for programming:  In binary search, insert position of an element is nothing but the ‘start’ position (i. e. return start) in a iterative version of binary search. Using insert position problem, helps you solve many similar binary search problems.  Java Long range can be from -10^18 to 10^18 (precisely: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to +9,223,372,036,854,775,807) If the number of occurances of more than two characters is odd, you cannot form a palindrome with it.  For palindromes, if the order doesn’t matter, may be go for a counting approach.  In a matrix, current diagonal can be identified with int currDiagonal = row - col; int currAntiDiagonal = row + col; For the graph to be a valid tree, it must have exactly n - 1 edges. Any less, and it can’t possibly be fully connected. Any more, and it has to contain cycles. Additionally, if the graph is fully connected and contains exactly n - 1 edges, it can’t possibly contain a cycle, and therefore must be a tree! In some questions they ask for MOD (of 10^9 + 7) if the range is high. In that case you can define mod as int MOD = (1e9 + 7). The answer will be x % MOD.  Time complexity of a recursive function is : O(Number of Branches ^ depth of each branch). "

    "body": "2022/06/05 - In this tutorial we will discuss 5 simple ways to read a file to string in Java. Writing real world application code in java involves file and string processing. Some of the common use cases to convert a file to string are as follows.  Read a JSON file and parse content from it.  Read a CSV file for machine learning input data. There are numerous other use cases for this. So given the huge number of applications, in this how to guide, we will discuss 5 simple and handpicked ways to read or convert a file into a String in Java. Depending upon your project configuration, you can use any of the following methods. 1. Using Java 1. 11+ inbuilt Files package:12345678import java. nio. file. Files;import java. nio. file. Path;String result = Files. readString(Path. of( filePath ));//To Write string to a file you can use String content =  Demo Content ;Files. writeString(filePath, content);This method works with Java 1. 11+ 2. Using Java 1. 8+ inbuilt Streams package:1String result = new String(Files. readAllBytes(Paths. get(filePath)), StandardCharsets. UTF_8);This method works with Java 1. 8+ 3. Native Java Scanner way:123try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(Paths. get(fileName), StandardCharsets. UTF_8. name())) {  String result = scanner. useDelimiter( \\A ). next();  } Note that “\A” represents regex pattern for useDelimiter scanner method. “\A” stands for :start of a string! . So when this pattern is supplied, whole stream is ready into the scanner object. 4. Apache commons-io IOUtils way:12File file = new File( data. txt );String result = FileUtils. readFileToString(file, StandardCharsets. UTF_8);For this method, Apache commons-io library should be included into your project. You can include it with the below maven link: https://mvnrepository. com/artifact/commons-io/commons-io/2. 6 5. Using Google Guava library:1String result = Files. toString(new File(path), Charsets. UTF_8);For this method, Guava library should be included into your project. You can include it with the below maven link: https://mvnrepository. com/artifact/com. google. guava/guava/r09 If you want to play around with actual InputStreams without any utility methods you can use the above style. If you feel there are any other better ways to convert the streams or if you have any questions please comment below. "

    "title": "Coding Interview Questions - Pattern 1 - Tries (Prefix Trees)",
    "body": "2022/06/05 - One of the most frequently asked coding interview questions for FAANG companies [Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX); and Alphabet (GOOG) (formerly known as Google). ] include Tries. Trie has multiple variants. But its very important to learn the data structure before going to onsite interviews. Lets get into the details of it. Top Interview Questions related to trie (Must Learn) include: Implement Trie Datastructure Desing Search Autocomplete Practical Application - Search Engine Auto Suggestion: Consider a search engine which does Auto suggestion. As seen in the image above, the moment we start typing the words like ‘wh’, we see sentence suggestions pop up based on the letters that are typed eg: whole foods, whatsapp etc. All these suggested sentences begin with the letters ‘wh’ . As we type more letters, all relevant suggestions help us lead to make our search faster. If we have to implement this kind of functionality, Brute force approach of storing all the sentences and iterating them to match the sentence prefixes with the letters typed would not help at scale.   Trie is the best data structure to use in this kind of scenarios. What is a Trie? Trie (also called as prefix tree) is a kind of search tree, where each node holds  A map of all the children with key : Next character, Value : Next character’s node. Reason that children are mapped as map is that the lookup can be faster using the starting character instead of a list.  A boolean whether the current node is a leaf or not. 1234class TrieNode {  Map&lt;Character, TrieNode&gt; childMap;  boolean amILeaf;}Sample Model: Consider the example sentences as “what”, “whatsapp”, “whole”, “whole foods” These sentences can be represented in the trie format as below: Sample WordList: “what”, “whatsapp”, “whole”, “whole foods” Root node in a trie is always empty. So blue node in the picture above is empty. But it can have multiple children. As we can see from the trie representation, since all the sample words start with the same letter ‘w’, the root node (in blue) has only one child with Node(‘w’). Node ‘w’ has one child node ‘h’ since all the words start with ‘wh’. Node(‘h’) has two children nodes Node (‘a’) and Node(‘o’) because the words can be started with ‘wha’ or ‘who’. Similarly words starting with ‘wha’ have ‘t’ as the next character. So only Node(‘t’) is the child of Node(‘a’). . As we reach Node(‘t’), we see that ‘what’ is actually part of the sample word list. So Node (‘t’) is marked as leaf node with the booleanvarilable amILeaf as true. Also Node(‘t’) has one possible next character as ‘s’ from the word (‘whatsapp’). So it has one child Node (‘s’) and the whole structure continues until all the words are covered as part of the leaf nodes. Construction/Insertion of Nodes: We construct the Trie by iterating each of the input words one by one. Each character of the input word is taken and the relationships are formed. For the sample list : “what”, “whatsapp”, “whole”, “whole foods”,Each word is iterated and inserted into the trie with the below code: 1234567891011121314151617181920class TrieNode {  Map&lt;Character, TrieNode&gt; childMap;  boolean amILeaf;}/** Inserts a word into the trie. */public void insert(TrieNode root, String word) {  TrieNode node = root;  for(char w : word. toCharArray()) {    if(node. map. get(w) == null) {      TrieNode child = new TrieNode();      node. map. put(w, child);    }    node = node. map. get(w);    //node reference changed to current node.   }    node. isLeaf = true;}For word “what” , ‘w’, ‘h’, ‘a’, ‘t’ are inserted character by character. From the childMap of root ‘w’ is queried. If its empty , new TrieNode child is created and inserted into the root map. If the node already exists, next character continues by assigning node with the current character. If there are no more characters left, then the node is marked as a leaf Same process continues for all the remaining words. Time complexity : O(m), where m is the word length. In each iteration of the algorithm, we either examine or create a node in the trie till we reach the end of the word. Space complexity : O(m). In the worst case newly inserted key doesn’t share a prefix with the the keys already inserted in the trie. We have to add mm new nodes, which takes us O(m) space. Search: 12345678910111213/** Returns if the word is in the trie. */public boolean search(TrieNode root, String word) {  Trie node = root;  for(char ch : word. toCharArray()) {    if(node. map. get(ch) == null) {      return false;    }    node = node. map. get(ch);  }    return node. isLeaf;  }  Search follows similar logic as insert. Each character of the word to be search is iterated and node is traversed one by one from the root. If at any instance, there is no node with the character of the search word, it means the word is not present in the word list. Time Complexity: O(m) : m is the length of the word to be searched. Space Complexity: O(1) Similar approach can be applied to the Auto Suggestion problem. Initially a trie is constructed with all the possible sentences. For the given input word , it can query the trie for all the words matched the searched prefix. "
